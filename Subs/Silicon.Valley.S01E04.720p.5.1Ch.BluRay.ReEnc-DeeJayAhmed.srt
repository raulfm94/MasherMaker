00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:12,005
Richie!

2
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,608
- Right on time.
- Hey. You're the lawyer?

3
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:17,688
Ron LaFlamme. Great to meet you.

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,921
(GRUNTS)

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,884
All right, homeboy. Pop a squat.

6
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:22,405
Start autographing by the flags.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,130
Lot of paper to get through.

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,090
So, what do you think?

9
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,321
About?

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,408
Jeannie. She's pretty hot, right?

11
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:40,280
Oh, yeah. No, she's... She's very pretty.

12
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,761
Yeah, she is.

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,570
Oh, we're doing that. Okay.

14
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:45,325
(CHUCKLES)

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,768
So yo, Peter tells me you're
popping your cherry with this.

16
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,080
So let me just walk you through it.

17
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,409
That stuff you're signing gives you
the convertible note for funding

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,960
and establishes you and Peter Gregory

19
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,130
as the board members of Pied Piper,
incorporated in the state of Delaware.

20
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:01,243
Okay. Why Delaware?

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,089
Rich, Rich.

22
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:06,403
Lawyer, not lawyer. I got you.

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,729
So, Peter Gregory, big fan of you.

24
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:13,922
- Oh.
- He invited you to his toga party, right?

25
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,889
That's a big deal. Flo Rida's playing.

26
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,849
- You dig Flo Rida?
- Should be fun.

27
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:19,729
- Yeah, I went to a lot...
- See this guitar?

28
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,640
Sergey and Larry from Google signed it.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,889
Both of them. Right there.

30
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:28,287
(STRUMS OFF-TUNE)

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,482
So, Pied Piper.

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,843
You're one of Peter's
compression plays, huh?

33
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:36,008
One of? How many does he have?

34
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:37,850
Not too many. Like six or eight.

35
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,048
Okay. Why are there so many?

36
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:42,931
You know how sea turtles
have a shit-ton of babies

37
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,441
because most of them die
on their way down to the water?

38
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,923
Peter just wants to make sure
that his money makes it to the ocean.

39
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,765
But it seems like you
got your shit together.

40
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,689
A lot of these guys come in here

41
00:01:52,800 --> 00:01:54,529
and they can do all the engineering stuff

42
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,648
but they get all hung up on technicalities.

43
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,525
They can't just tell you
what their vision for the company is.

44
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,690
Those guys are so fucked.

45
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,760
It's like you need both halves
of the brain, right?

46
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:08,447
The Jobs and the Wozniak.
The ying and the yang.

47
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,087
Ch. I think it's "Yin".

48
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:13,005
- "Yin"? (CHUCKLES)
- Yeah.

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,160
- Like "Yin and yan?"
- No. Like yin and yang.

50
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,245
No. It's ying and yang, they're opposites.

51
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:23,569
So, Pied Piper, drop it on me. What is it?

52
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,688
Well, we started off as a music app.

53
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:27,807
Yuck.

54
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:31,290
Yeah. Gross.
(AWKWARD CHUCKLE)

55
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:33,840
But we've pivoted since then.

56
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,929
Uh-oh. To what?

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,322
Well, our Weissman scores
are consistently high across all media,

58
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,402
audio, video, meta-data.

59
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,490
Actually, that's not true.
We've had some trouble encoding 3D video.

60
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,965
- I think it's because the pixels change...

- (PLAYING GUITAR THROUGH AMPLIFIER)

62
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,767
Just look at the flow diagram, dude.

63
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,241
No, the filter bank
is part of the prediction loop.

64
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:13,444
What are you talking about,
this is lossless compression.

65
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,682
Oh, hey, Big Head, you were there.

66
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,122
Why did Richard use a DCT filter bank?

67
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,601
Oh...

68
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:25,925
Not really sure.
Richard tried to explain some of this stuff

69
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,365
but a lot of it I didn't really understand,

70
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,442
so I'd kinda just nod and smile, you know?

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,243
Can you at least help us figure out
this insane DFT spider web he's using?

72
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,441
(CHORTLES)

73
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,165
Dude, do you understand any of this?

74
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,166
I eat the fish.

75
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,924
I understand you eat the fish.

76
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,845
But when you clean the fish

77
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:55,050
you can't leave the fish head
and guts and shit in the sink.

78
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,208
Because the whole house
smells like a bait station.

79
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,121
So you gotta put it in the trash
and then take the trash out.

80
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,001
Do you understand?

81
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,523
Yes. I eat the fish.

82
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:07,120
Motherfuck!

83
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,928
Do you know how awkward it is to not be
able to describe your own company?

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,764
Like, I built Pied Piper and you can see it

85
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,888
but I can't really
describe to you what it is

86
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:17,769
even though I kind of know where I'm going.

87
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,003
You do realize we quit working
on our own apps to work for you, right?

88
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,687
Shouldn't you more than
"Kind of know where you're going?"

89
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,848
Because that's basically what the CEO does.

90
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,321
I do. Sort of.

91
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,445
RICHARD: Okay, it's like trying to tell
someone how to get somewhere,

92
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,562
even though you don't really know
the exact address. Right?

93
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,444
Like, how do you do that?
Because you can't just say

94
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,601
"Go to 415 Elm Street,"

95
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,045
because you don't even know
what that is. Right?

96
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,446
So you have to say, you know,

97
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:43,364
"Go straight down that big road
and take a right at the weird thing."

98
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:44,720
But, you can't describe
what that weird thing is

99
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,840
because you just know
it as a weird thing, you know,

100
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,286
in your head. You always have.

101
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,721
Is that weird thing in
your head an aneurysm?

102
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:53,925
Richard, I'm just gonna recap for a second,

103
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,528
you turned down 10 million dollars

104
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:00,127
to be able to develop something that you,
as the head of the company,

105
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:02,521
can't even describe to another human being?

106
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,209
I say this only to motivate you.

107
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,930
Okay, so I have been
instructed to remove you

108
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,811
from the list of employees
assigned to the Nucleus project.

109
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:17,687
You will no longer receive any
Nucleus related communications,

110
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:21,484
file reports, or attend
any Nucleus meetings.

111
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,526
Any questions?

112
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:27,126
No. That's... That's pretty clear.

113
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,641
Great.

114
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,248
Am I being reassigned to something else?

115
00:05:31,640 --> 00:05:35,725
Not that I am aware of. At this time. No.

116
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,165
Wait, so then am I being fired?

117
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:39,971
Because I have a three year contract
and my stock options...

118
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:43,123
Okay. Nobody is being fired. Okay?

119
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:45,681
Look, a contract is a contract.

120
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:49,401
You know. You've got a contract.
And I've got a contract.

121
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:51,403
We all have contracts.

122
00:05:51,480 --> 00:05:55,371
And here at Hooli, contracts are honored.

123
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,611
Yours and mine.

124
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,204
Everybody's. So...

125
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,885
Have I made that perfectly clear?

126
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,963
Yeah, no. That's clear.

127
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,801
But, when I come into work
tomorrow, what do I do?

128
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,644
That is unclear. At this time.

130

my underwear and a bed sheet.

- Underwear? Pussy.
- Yeah. I'm with him.

132
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,970
This is the type of evening
that requires free-balling.

00:06:35,960 --> 00:06:39,009
Oh. I'm gonna take my underwear off too.

Richard! Hey, you made it!

135

So Peter met with LaFlamme today
and signed the paperwork,

136
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,010
which means Pied Piper
is officially launched.

137
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,961
Why didn't you tell me about all the
other compression plays Peter was seeding?

138
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:57,289
What? No... Because it's nothing
you need to worry about.

139
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,920
Because none of those other
companies have your vision.

140
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,005
- My vision?
- Exactly.

141
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,368
Speaking of which,
Peter really wants you to come in on Friday

142
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,851
to chat about big picture stuff.

143
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,764
You know, lay out your vision
in broad strokes.

144
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,763
Broad strokes for the vision of the...

00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:12,890
Well, Pied Piper is compression
and we all know that.

146
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,891
So we don't need to talk about that,
but I could because I'm the CEO.

147
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,090
Pied Piper takes the data and...

148
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,531
Smaller... To smaller form.

149
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:25,331
And, also, there's more.

150
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,331
It compresses the data overall...

Oh, through work.

We're actresses.

Cool.

What type of actressing work?

171
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,165
Oh, we're working right now.

172
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,444
Our startup sources actors
to parties to liven things up

173
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:29,729

So, who else is paid to be here?

176
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:39,402
Pretty much anyone that's
over a seven is with us,

177
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,528
and anyone that's under a three is a guest.

178

It's a really fun job.

- Game.
- Game, yes! That's it.

209
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,490
You know, I always knew
I was missing something

210
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,131
and then someone explained
to me the concept of game,

211
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:44,280
I remember very distinctly thinking,
"That's what I don't have. Game."

and it is all good.

What were you thinking?

You don't put someone inside
the company on the board.

Then he and Peter Gregory can vote you out.

Yeah. You gotta find an outsider you trust.

"it looks like Richard
is going to suck Erlich's dick."

Yes. I mean,

288
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,244
is there a reason I wasn't
invited to the party?

289
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,040
Is there some sense that
I'm not part of the gang?

00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,971
What? Jared.

291
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,966
Of course not. it was just an oversight.

I mean, we weren't even sure
if we were gonna go.

I suppose. I had a fine night.

298
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:36,530
I had some palak paneer
and I watched a documentary about Liberia.

299
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:41,089
But then I woke up to this
unexpected development.

300
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:43,561
Do you...
Do you really want Erlich on the board?

301

- Because I'll support you...
- No. I don't. At all.

I don't know how to get out of it.

304
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,967
I mean, what am I going
to say to Peter Gregory?

305
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,963
Well, if you don't sign the documents,
and you don't give them to Peter Gregory,

306
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,769
then it won't happen. Simple as that.

Gilfoyle, okay, off to
the center a little bit.

317
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,644
Like your personality. No, no, no, no.

318
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,207
Dinesh, leave it unbuttoned.
We want you to look like shit.

319
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,050
Makes for a better "Before" photo.

320
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:33,600
But you're wearing a jacket.

321
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:36,084
Yeah, because I'm the genius marketer.

322
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,804
I'm not a code freak like you guys.

323
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:41,760
Besides, I'm wearing sandals
so I am iconoclasting a little bit.

324
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:45,044
Oh, good. Jared.
What the fuck is with that vest?

325
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:48,050
Right over here.
As if you're sort of a late addition

326
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:51,488
that may not stick around
for the entire duration of the company.

327
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,245
And then, Richard.
There you go. The man of the hour.

328
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,647
Okay. We'll take a few like this,

329
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,767
and then just Richard and I.

330
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,451
Because at the end of the day,

331
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:05,163
people only want to see a picture
of the board members.

332
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,404
It... Actually, it's...

333
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,684
You're not gonna be a board member.

334
00:17:12,120 --> 00:17:13,610
- What?
- (CAMERA BEEPING)

335
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:15,487
(CAMERA CLICKS)

336
00:17:15,560 --> 00:17:17,449
I'm in year three of a five year deal

337
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:19,522
and, Matt, you got what,
like three years left?

338
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:22,127
Yeah. We all got acquired by Hooli,

339
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:25,010
when we didn't work out,
none of us got reassigned.

340
00:17:25,080 --> 00:17:29,529
Because Gavin believes in this
Japanese form of management

341
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,928
where not being assigned
is the most shameful outcome.

342
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,121
(LAUGHTER)

343
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,483
Yeah, it does feel uncomfortable.

344
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,241
Give it a week or two,
you'll get, like, numb to it.

345
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,961
Well, why are you guys still coming in?

346
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:43,810
Rest and vest.

347
00:17:44,360 --> 00:17:45,407
Oh...

348
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,721
Because in order to fully
vest your options,

349
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:50,406
you've gotta wait until
your contracts are up.

350
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:52,528
- I get it.
- You catch on slow.

351
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,240
You'll fit right in here.

352
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:57,285
Lunch? Arby's on El Camino? I'll drive.

353
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,643
No, let's walk. It'll take longer.

354
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,520
Gotta do something to fill the day, right?

355
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:03,802
I was drunk! You took advantage of me!

356
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:06,400
- Man, they are really going at it.
- (ERLICH CONTINUES YELLING)

357
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,003
So, last night, what was
the girl situation?

358
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,724
And after all I've given
up for this company.

359
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:15,325
Oh, what have you given up?

360
00:18:15,560 --> 00:18:18,848
I owned 10% of Dinesh's app,
10% of Gilfoyle's app.

361
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,208
Multiple potential streams of income.

362
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,449
Not to mention that 100%
of the team that you have,

363
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:26,682
were all guys that I
recruited for this house.

364
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,088
- That must be worth something to me.
- It is.

365
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,765
10% of Pied Piper!

366
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,531
For which I forewent,
yes, that's a real word,

367
00:18:33,680 --> 00:18:35,569
one million dollars.

368
00:18:36,120 --> 00:18:38,521
I supported you, Richard. I bet on you.

369
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:40,928
And now you're just gonna
give me a seat on the board,

370
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,764
only to retract that offer?

371
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,888
I can't even remember doing that!

372
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,561
Oh, really? Well, do you remember
this particular dick-bag I got on video?

373
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,366
Because you did.

374
00:18:51,840 --> 00:18:53,001
Put it away.

375
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,646
It's right here.

376
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,327
Goddammit.

377
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:00,161
- I've seen the video.
- It's the wrong album, just give me a sec...

378
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,201
You know what? Fuck it!

379
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,726
You offering me a position on this board
and reneging it

380
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,247
is a perfect example of
you having no vision,

381
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,368
no balls and no game.

382
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,280
Maybe he did blow him.

383
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,010
- Well, love and hate. It's all passion.
- (ERLICH CONTINUES YELLING)

384
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,129
And if that's the kind of
company you wanna run,

385
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:17,287
well, then, fine.

386
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:19,926
God help you. 'Cause I sure as hell ain't.

387
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:21,925
What are you doing?

388
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,365
You give your loyalty to somebody...

389
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,720
- Let me help you.
- Don't touch!

390
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,605
I can do it myself.

391
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:27,961
All right.

392
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:34,084
I just put it back on. Goddammit!

393
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,766
Okay. Read that back to me.

394
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,129
"Pied Piper's mission is to bring its unique
compression algorithm to a variety..."

395
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,850
One thing you should know
about living in this house

396
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:44,729
is I do not tolerate substance abuse.

397
00:19:44,800 --> 00:19:47,531
There's no drinking and
lying in this house.

398
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:50,531
I should have made that more clear
to some of the current residents.

399
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:52,927
Like this one. Don't mind him.

400
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,844
He'll be gone soon
when his company cakes its pants.

401
00:19:56,040 --> 00:19:59,647
Hopefully, Jurgen, you'll be able to bring
a more positive element to the house.

402
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:01,405
Let me show you the room I'm offering.

403
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:03,164
Some of his stuff is still in there,

404
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:05,447
but, as I mentioned, it will soon be gone.

405
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,764
Once his company cakes its pants.

406
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:11,649
It's okay. Just take a breath.

407
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:13,524
It's fine. I'm fine. We just...

408
00:20:13,600 --> 00:20:15,841
Let's get through this.
Okay, so, read this back to me.

409
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,801
- "Pied Piper's mission..."
- Hey, guys.

410
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,962
Hope you don't mind,
the front door was just open.

411
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,246
Hi, Big Head. What's up?

412
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:26,331
Honestly? Nothing.
I've just been sitting around all day.

413
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,041
Not working. It's weird, you know?
(SIGHS)

414
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,167
Yeah.

415
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:36,361
- So, what's up with you guys?
- (RATTLING)

416
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:37,726
We're just sort of...

417
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:40,167
We're getting ready for this big
Peter Gregory meeting.

418
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:42,931
And we have a lot of work to do, so...

419
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,845
Cool. Very cool.

420
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,202
(RATTLING CONTINUES)

421
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:53,001
You know, Richard, the irony is that
if you had taken the ten million,

422
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:55,242
you'd be kicking back
with a ton of money right now

423
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,321
and I'd still be working.

424
00:20:56,440 --> 00:20:59,728
But you didn't, obviously.
And now I've got nothing to do,

425
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:03,327
I'm rolling in it,
and you're working your ass off.

426
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:05,841
Life's funny isn't it?

427
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,005
You guys want to walk to Arby's,

428
00:21:10,120 --> 00:21:12,361
maybe grab a bite, play
a little hacky sack?

429
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,964
Yeah. I should probably
get back to work, anyway.

430
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,805
I mean, not work, exactly, I don't...

431
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:24,770
I don't work.
But, you know, just get back to Hooli.

432
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,170
Sit around all day and get paid
a bunch of money to do nothing.

433
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,486
(CHUCKLES) Weird.

434
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,964
- You ready?
- (SIGHS)

435
00:21:36,040 --> 00:21:37,883
You know what you're going to say?
You want to run it by me?

436
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,406
No, no. I got this. Fuck Erlich.

437
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,120
You know, I turned down ten million dollars
to build this thing.

438
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,810
You want vision,
I will show you fucking vision.

439
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,247
I like this new angry side to you.

440
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,763
Being around angry people relaxes me,
because I know where I stand.

441
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:56,241
(SUCKS TEETH)

442
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,163
Oh, shoot. I think I got something
stuck in my teeth.

443
00:21:58,240 --> 00:22:01,084
I'm just gonna go to the bathroom,
check it out. I'll be back in a sec.

444
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:20,761
Richard, it's Jared. Are you okay?

445
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:22,921
(DOOR UNLOCKS)

446
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,285
(WATER RUNNING)

447
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,724
Hey buddy, what's going on here?

448
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,323
I thought I had something in my teeth,

449
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,570
but when I looked over, right?
I looked in the mirror like this,

450
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,565
my pants, they hit the counter top,

451
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,529
and it must have some
water on there, right?

452
00:22:44,600 --> 00:22:47,721
So I got a spot on my pants, kinda looked
like I pissed myself like a big baby.

453
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,729
So what I did was, I just
took off all my pants

454
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:51,803
and I put it in the water
just to make it all completely wet.

455
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,610
You know, that way I figured
no one would really notice.

456
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,603
So, you know, it wouldn't be as bad.
I've got it under control.

457
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,011
I've sorted it out. We're good.

458
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:00,927
Yes. So you felt this wouldn't look as bad.

459
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,171
- Understood.
- Yeah.

460
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:05,449
But, Richard?

461
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,406
Consider that maybe this might not be
the best choice for the meeting?

462
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:13,571
Yeah. Holy...

463
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,531
What the fuck am I doing?

464
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,685
I can't go like this to the meeting.

465
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,406
Jared. I have no vision.

466
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,766
Yes, you do.

467
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,481
- I believe in you...
- No, no, I literally have no vision.

468
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,042
All I see is stars and swirls.
I cannot see right now.

469
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,361
- Okay, okay, let's get your pants on.
- (KNOCK ON DOOR)

470
00:23:31,680 --> 00:23:33,330
MONICA: Richard? Jared? Are you in there?

471
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:34,841
Ohh.

472
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,208
Hey, there's some weather over the ocean

473
00:23:39,320 --> 00:23:41,481
so Peter would love to get started.
Are you guys ready?

474
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,522
Yep. All good. Be there in a jiffy.

475
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:44,681
- Okay.
- RICHARD: Oh.

476
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:48,282
Jared, I'm on a carpet in a bathroom.

477
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,688
Yeah, okay.

478
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:54,601
I know this isn't the best thing to say
to someone having a panic attack,

479
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,650
but we need to hurry here.

480
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,489
- Doing okay?
- Yes, much better.

481
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,166
Nope. Worse.

482
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:05,567
Richard, you're gonna listen to me
if you know what's good for you.

483
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,647
Erlich.

484
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,643
I may have been wrong
about being a board member

485
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,963
and I may be wrong about being
the Steve Jobs in our relationship.

486
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,811
But I do know this,
you are the Steve Wozniak.

487
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:18,203
And no Woz should go into
a meeting like that alone.

488
00:24:18,800 --> 00:24:19,881
No. Actually...

489
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:23,123
So if you'll just let me come in,
then I won't speak.

490
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,441
And I just think you should
have somebody in there

491
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,409
who will actually have your back.

492
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,571
Okay. No, I... Erlich, I
want you to be in there.

493
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,371
Okay... Wait, what?

494
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:34,811
Yes, and I need you to do all the talking.

495
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:37,480
Because I feel like if I do
I'm gonna puke all over Peter Gregory.

496
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,722
Oh. Okay. Wow.

497
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,282
That was easier than I... All the talking?

498
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,689
Oh, Erlich, you're here too?

499
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:46,765
Okay. Come on in, guys.

500
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:50,005
I'm going to stay here, I think.
Because I look absurd.

501
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:53,325
Yeah. Yeah, okay.

502
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,251
So what are you going to say?

503
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,171
Fuck, I don't know.

504
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,081
(SIGHS)

505
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:03,761
(WATER DRIPPING)

506
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,685
Today's user wants access
to all of their files

507
00:25:06,800 --> 00:25:09,121
from all their devices instantly.

508
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,562
That's why cloud-based is the Holy Grail.

509
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,444
Now Dropbox is winning,

510
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:15,808
but when it comes to audio and video files,

511
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,161
they might as well be called Dripbox.

512
00:25:18,760 --> 00:25:19,761
(CHUCKLES)

513
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:25,611
Using our platform, Pied Piper users would
be able to compress all of their files

514
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:29,567
to the point where they truly
can access them instantly.

515
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:31,521
We control the pipe,

516
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,521
they just use it.

517
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,681
That's the vision in
Richard Hendricks' head.

518
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,121
Sure.

519
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:50,480
Sounds fine.

520
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:52,367
Oh.

521
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,887
I received an email from Ron LaFlamme

522
00:25:56,200 --> 00:25:59,090
saying that this gentleman

523
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,602
is going to be our third board member?

524
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,122
Yes. Yes.

525
00:26:09,040 --> 00:26:11,520
Erlich helped me with all this stuff.
He's very talented.

526
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,285
I need him as a partner.

527
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,566
Fine.

528
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:27,082
It's okay for you to leave now.

529
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:28,560
All right, okay.

530
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,849
Wait, is that you and Gavin Belson?

531
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,689
Yes. It's an old photograph.

532
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,687
Were you guys friends?

533
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,366
I thought so.

534
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:47,366
Good-bye.

535
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,241
- How'd it go?
- (SHOES SQUISHING)

536
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,560
That was amazing.

537
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:56,166
I mean, that was like everything
in my head, but, like, clear.

538
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:57,840
Did you just make that up on the spot?

539
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,124
Yeah. We should probably
write some of it down.

540
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,124
Yeah. Well, look. I gotta be honest,

541
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,766
I mean, I can't tell you
how much this means.

542
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,247
You really saved my ass
even after I was such a dick to you.

543
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,727
- You're making up!
- What else could I do, Richard?

544
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:13,251
You're my Wozniak.

545
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,085
- And I will always be...
- (GROANS)

546
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,527
(GRUNTS)

547
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:20,647
Motherfu...
