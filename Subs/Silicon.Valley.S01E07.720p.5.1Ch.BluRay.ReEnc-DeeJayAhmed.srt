The core compression algorithm is optimal.

2
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,685
All the test cases ran optimal.

3
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:16,731
The Weissman Score is optimal.
Looks like Nucleus is optimal.

Good. Good.

5
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:20,651
Congratulations, guys.

00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:25,680
- Oh, yeah.
- A dunk.

7
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,644
Richard, the ingestion engine is ready
for testing. Have you seen Richard?

8
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:42,644
He's in there, having a little trouble
with his personal ingestion engine.

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,883
Still? It's been an hour.
He's gotta get this done.

10
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,804
Oh, he's got his laptop in there,
on top of his lap.

11
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:51,728
Hey, Richard.

12
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:53,609
RICHARD: Don't talk to me while
I'm in the bathroom please.

13
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,330
Well, snap it off, we gotta go.

14
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,402
RICHARD: I know.
Just don't talk to me while I'm in here.

15
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,561
It's weird.

16
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,086
Oh, my God.
Jared's been back from that island

17
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,288
for a whole day
and he didn't get any toilet paper?

18
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,681
Are you serious? ls Jared out there?

19
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:07,569
I thought you didn't want me to talk to you

20
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,600
while you were in the bathroom.
Make up your mind.

21
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:11,688
RICHARD: You know what?
Just get away from the door, please.

- Yes.

24
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:18,289
And tomorrow is trash day
so make sure all the cans are out front.

Yes.

Yes.

Okay, has anything that I've
just said confused you?

30
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,201
- Yes.
- God damn it!

I'm a pro, Dinesh. I
won't apologize for it.

I dress according to the moods
that I sense in the room.

34
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,480
As such, I must have options.

35
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,369
We all packed and ready to go?

No.

how you read your screen in the car.

43
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,005
It makes me sick as a dog.

44

as long as I don't think about it.

Besides, the presentation is tomorrow.

about it, it really doesn't bother you

00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,680
to be staring at the screen

being stuck on that island for four days,

00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:43,008
but I think I'm on top of everything.

Okay, uh, give me your IDs
and I'll go register us...

There you are.
Got your credentials and wristbands

for the walk through at 4:00 today.

Uh, walk through?

58
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,441
Yeah, basically,
it's a sound check for the competition.

59
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,449
Uh, yeah, we didn't know about that.

60
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,649
Did I not tell you about the walk through?

61
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:01,209
I am so sorry.

62
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,009

with Lorne Michaels and Kanye West

attention on you guys for once.

I am so sorry. I thought that I talked

Okay, guys,
this place is a vortex of distraction.

Normally the tech world is 2% women.

Don't screw it all up now.

We have to knock them dead
in the preliminaries tomorrow

76
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:50,128
so we can move on to the finals on Friday.

77
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,524
I have a question. The program says
that Dan Melcher is judging our round.

78
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:56,329
Is there any way to get him removed?

79
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,562
Not unless there's a conflict of interest.

80
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,008
Well, there may be. I did have
sexual intercourse with his wife.

81
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,003
What? It was three years ago.

82
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,367
So one of the guys judging us
wants to fucking kill you?

83
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,602
Maybe. I don't know if he found out.

84
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,968
Either way, Richard, you may have to
present instead of me so be prepared.

85
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,441
What, me? Present? No.

86
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,126
We may be fine. We may be totally fine.

87
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,521
We also may be totally fucked.

88
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,090
I'll let you know either way.

89
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:25,841
I'm gonna go network. Don't approach me.

90
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,121
I don't want to present.
Besides, I'm not even done with the demo.

91
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,522
Okay, Richard, you need to go
to the hotel right now and finish.

92
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,811
- You already checked us into the hotel?
- Yeah. Yeah.

so I'm gonna start with you first, okay?

Okay, you guys set up the booth, okay?

96
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,802
Um, I think it's this way.

00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:25,242
and I just cannot seem
to figure out this stupid bug. Do you mind?

Uh, okay, yeah.

132
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:22,167
I saw her at the Valleywag
party last night,

133
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,961
which was crazy, by the way. Dude, there
must've been like 12 girls there.

- Holy shit. (CHUCKLES)
- Nuts.

135
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:30,889
Anyway, um, she said you guys
went out a couple times

136
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,567
and then, uh, she dumped you
and you became obsessed with her?

What? What? She said I was obsessed?

138

She said obsessed.

Uh, that's bullshit,
'cause I think we went out two times.

140
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,724
Eh, it was nothing.
So, how could I be obsessed? That's...

Yeah.

so fucked up, right?

00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:49,240
And it's just so insulting to have someone
walking around spreading lies about you.

156
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:52,443
Right? I wonder who she's working with.

157
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,683
Like I wonder who she's here with
because if she's telling her coworkers,

158
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:58,331
then that's a whole 'nother
group of people I gotta worry about.

159
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,004
Richard, you don't have
to worry about anything

160
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,650
- except for Pied Piper right now.
- Yeah, I know.

161
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:04,166
We have less than 24
hours till the preliminaries.

162
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,121
- No one's worrying, that's the thing. Perfect.
- Perfect.

163
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,166
Okay, her.

164
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,600
She used the word "obsessed," Dinesh.

165
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:18,120
- "Obsessed."
- Richard, I don't care.

166
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:22,244
Neither do I. That's the entire point.

167
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:23,761
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

168
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,281
I'm just gonna check her
lnstagram real quick.

169
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,522
Because if she's posting
comments about me being obsessed...

170
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,720
- I mean, I can't just ignore that.
- (SIGHING DEEPLY)

171
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:38,330
Would you be interested in a device
that links to your smartphone

172
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:41,244
and lets you know, even before it happens,
whether you're having a panic attack

173
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,685
- or a heart attack?
- Yeah, yeah.

174
00:08:42,760 --> 00:08:44,285
Okay, here's how Panic-a-Tech works.

175
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:46,567
You wear this on your finger all day
and it tracks your vitals.

176
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,122
Or if that's too embarrassing,
there's also a Bluetooth suppository

177
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,886
and that goes right where you think it goes.
And that comes with a retrieval kit.

178
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:57,248
Was he like, "Bro, you're my bro,"

179
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:01,970
or was he like, "I wanna shoot you in the face
and watch you bleed out all over the stage

180
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,361
"'cause you fucked my wife, you cocksuck?"

181
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,284
Right in the middle. It was like...

182
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,886
Huh.

183
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,924
What happened? How's it going at the hotel?

184
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,085
Weird. He switched to meta-data extraction
and now wants to see you.

185
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:20,091
Meta-data? Already? Makes no sense.

186
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,685
DINESH: He seems very distracted.

187
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:27,924
Okay, guys, urn, since we're kind of
playing from behind here

188
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,401
I put together a little secret weapon.

189
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,082
I, um... I went through the entire list
of conference participants

190
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,130
and I found images and I found bios
and I printed them out

191
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,326
so we have them all in one place.

192
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,131
- Why did you do that?
- Uh, okay.

193
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,851
Who's this guy? Watch. He is...

Rick Smith, co-founder
of Crosscut Ventures.

196
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:50,446
How did you...

197
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:54,286
ID-Keen. It's this facial recognition app
that Monica put on our phones.

198
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,249
You just point it at anybody,
tells you who they are

199
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,129
and how important they
are to the conference.

200
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,210
(PHONES BEEPING)

201
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,126
(SCOFFS) You're not showing up at all.

202
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:07,046
Yeah, maybe I'm not getting a...
No, I'm getting a signal.

203
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,527
Okay. Um, well...

204
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,283
Ooh, Jared, Jared, uh,
recycling's over there.

205
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,966
Hey, so what's the deal?
Does the judge know or not?

206
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,883
I don't know, Monica. He's toying with me.

207
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,964
Or maybe he's not.
I can't fucking figure it out.

208
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,930
MONICA: Erlich, you need to stop this.
His wife is here.

209
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:29,207
Grow a pair and talk to
her, find out for sure.

210
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:32,170
Why don't you grow a pair
and I'll talk to her?

211
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,481
Hmm.

212
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:34,881
What?

213
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,565
Hey-

214
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,485
Do you happen to know Java?

215
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,287
Are you kidding? It's like my specialty.

216
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,725
Will you help me?

217
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,131
Oh, it would be my honor.

218

(DOOR OPENING)

219
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:12,240
Yes?

220
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,449
Oh, sorry. Um, I must not
have the right room.

221
00:11:15,520 --> 00:11:18,364
- I'm looking for Dan Melcher.
- Yeah, that's us.

222
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,965
Oh, it is? Okay.

223
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,929
I was looking to speak with his wife.

224
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:26,723
That's me. I'm, well, his new
wife, we just got married.

225
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:28,404
Oh, congratulations.

226
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:31,606
Uh, what happened with Madelyn?

227
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,527
- You're a friend of Dan's?
- Yeah.

228
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,001
We've... We have a common interest...

229
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:39,287
- Uh, many common interests.
- Yeah.

230
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,964
Well, she was a nightmare.

231
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,887
Pills, in and out of rehab.

232
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,885
Had all of these disgusting affairs.

233
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,564
You know, the divorce nearly killed Dan.

234
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,371
Really? Disgusting affairs.

235
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,483
Well, I... I feel terrible.

236
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,245
No, it's fine. He's put it behind him.

237
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,211
All Of it?

238
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,322
- I mean, every aspect of it?
- Mmm-hmm.

Well, that is... That is great to hear.

to everyone at this conference?

or I have to punch you in the face.

Hey, how's the demo coming?

247
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:29,482
Um, we're getting there. (SIGHS)

248
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:31,090
Uh, definitely... Getting there.

249
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:33,808
Gentlemen, I bring good tidings.

250
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,090
Turns out that Melcher
is divorced, remarried

251
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:41,562
and has put the previous relationship
behind him completely.

252
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,846
Problem solved.

253
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,285
That's great.

254
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,410
It sure is, Richard, it sure as hell is.

even know what's about to hit 'em.

I thought you guys were gonna come get me

00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,963
and... (STAMMERING) And I'm sorry.

260
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:03,407
- Wait, Jared, what are you doing here?
- What?

261
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,527
- Who's watching the booth?
- Yeah.

262
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,807
- I thought that maybe Monica could...
- MONICA: Ooh.

263
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,645
She's not in the company.
We need her here. That's the thing.

264
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,451
All right, everybody, uh, this run-through
is for essential personnel only,

265
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:13,925
essential only.

266
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,161
Oh.

267
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,130
- We need someone in the booth is the thing.
- Right.

268
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:21,645
You're essential to the booth.

269
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,846
JARED: Right.

270
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:27,043
All right, each team will have
six minutes for presentation and demo,

271
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,685
at which point the judges
will ask a few questions...

272
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:30,808
Uh, do you mind if I break in here,
just one question.

273
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,531
Uh, are the judges allowed
to send us through

274
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,967
to the finals immediately after we present

275
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:41,126
or do we have to wait
until everyone else has gone?

276
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,090
Well, I'm just saying
what everybody's thinking.

00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,047
She invited me to her room
to watch <i>Cloud Atlas</i> later tonight.

308
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,327
Oh, yeah,
that means she wants you to lay her.

309
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,084
Is that definitive?

310
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:08,481
I mean, nobody can watch more
than like a minute of that film.

311
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,722
So what's the deal? I mean, is she hot?

312
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,211
Yeah, I mean, she's attractive,

313
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:15,568
but almost every woman is attractive.
It was her mind.

314
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:20,563
She wrote this Java method that was the most
beautiful thing I've ever seen in my life.

315
00:15:20,640 --> 00:15:22,324
Elegant, tight.

316
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:25,890
There's just something so hot
about a woman that can code like that.

317
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:27,530
You know, I just want to

318
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,490
- crawl in her frontal lobe and...
- (SNICKERING)

319
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:31,846
What's up?

320
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,642
You know I wrote that code, right?

321
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,291
No, this code was on her system.

322
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,126
A banged up 15-inch MacBook Pro
with shitty stickers on it?

323
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,885
Everyone here has a beat up
15-inch MacBook Pro...

324
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,327
With a 1.3 chip and only two gigs of RAM?

325
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,802
She doesn't know Java. I wrote that code.

326
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,531
- You said you were in love with her mind.
- Oh, fuck.

327
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,848
You realize what's going on, right?

328
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,208
It's not her you're sexually attracted to,
it's my code.

329
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:02,762
Shut the... That is the most
disgusting fucking thing I've ever heard.

330
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:06,401
Just face it, Dinesh,
you're gay for my code, you're code gay.

331
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,882
No! No, I'm into her.
Her, okay? Fuck your code!

332
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,644
You'd like to fuck my code, wouldn't you?

333
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:14,485
Hey, would you like to masturbate
to the subroutine I just wrote?

334
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,881
No! It's... I'm... I'm...

335
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,406
And then I'll sort of close
right here in the center

336
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:21,482
with a confidence and poise that, well,

337
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,723
they probably won't have seen
up until this point.

338
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:28,600
And then at that point we've got some photos
that we're gonna throw up on the big screen.

339
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:31,160

- Yeah, you know, just a few.

I was showing you to my friends

to prove a point that
I'm not obsessed with you.

of my waking life for the past
two months to him, okay?

00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:00,004
I am devoted to him and to the precious
thing that we're building together!

405
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:02,924
I'm his partner. I can
tell when he's vomiting...

00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,206
- Uh, what? No.
- JARED: because he's nervous...

407
00:20:04,280 --> 00:20:06,726
- Never mind, Kate, I'm fine.
- ...or when he's vomiting because he's sick

408
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:09,087
or when he's vomiting
because he had cilantro, which he loves

409
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,049
but he shouldn't have
because it makes him...

I mean it, I am so sorry.

I mean, I'm obsessed with her...

412
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,723
Richard, can I talk to you for a second?

413
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:25,445
Uh, okay.

414
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,730
I owe you an apology. I was way off base.

415
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:34,723
Well, yeah, you were.

416

He cleared it all up for me.

00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,645
- RICHARD: Jared? Really?
- Yeah. He's your partner, right?

418
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:43,130
Yeah, he is. One of many. (SIGHS)

Obviously you're not obsessed with me.

422
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,610
Richard, it's none of my business,
but be safe.

423
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:57,809
- Okay?
- Okay.

Of course I'm safe. I backup my
whole system like five times a day.

thank you.
