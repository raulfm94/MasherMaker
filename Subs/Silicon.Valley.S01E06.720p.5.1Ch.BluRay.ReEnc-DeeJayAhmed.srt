1
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:10,284
Kidney function, liver function,
testosterone...

2
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,481
I don't know how you did it,

3
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:15,206
but you have essentially aged 40 years
in the last seven weeks.

4
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:16,645
Wow. Really?

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,529
We had a meth addict in here this morning

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:21,843
who was biologically younger
than you are, and he's 58.

7
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:24,091
MySpace guy.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,245
So what is going on?

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,647
Uh...

10
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,007
It's this cloud service configuration,

11
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,765
- I've been stuck on it for over a week.
- Wow.

12
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:35,525
I'm a good programmer.
I mean, it's the only thing I am good at.

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,489
I mean, last year,
I threw a Frisbee and I chipped my tooth.

14
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,925
Oh, that's more of a dental issue.

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,411
Yup, okay, I...

16
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,121
The point is, I learned Ruby on Rails
over a weekend when I was 17.

17
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,521
I should be able to learn cloud, I have to.

18
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,001
May I give you my professional opinion,
as your doctor?

19
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:53,363
You should have taken that $10 million
from Gavin Belson, okay?

20
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,611
But regrets will kill ya,
so try not to dwell on it.

21
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:58,284
I tried to tell you.

22
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,362
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

23
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:12,563
Outside help?
No, we're not getting any outside help.

24
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,530
It's a week until TechCrunch, Richard.
We can't wait any longer.

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,523
Richard, look at the board.

26
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,401
Okay, cloud architecture is just a giant
turd that is clogging up our pipes.

27
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,608
We have to call in a plumber to fix it.

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:27,763
Okay, I hate that metaphor,
but Erlich is right.

29
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,810
Gilfoyle and I finished
the distribution services days ago

30
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,530
and we're just sitting
around waiting for you.

31
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:35,843
- I can solve it.
- Richard, you're a fucking rock star, okay?

32
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,729
You just don't know cloud,

33
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:42,522
this tiny, little, shitty area,
which is becoming super important,

34
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,682
and in many ways is the
future of computing.

35
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:49,929
That sort of went south on me,
but you understand what I'm saying.

36
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,890
I've already talked to Peter Gregory
about insourcing a consultant.

37
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,691
I've made contact with a programmer
whose cloud architecture

38
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:58,929
is supposed to be insane.
They call him The Carver.

39
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,126
The Carver?

40
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,404
That Black Hat guy who apparently hacked
into the Bank of America

41
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:05,562
and took down their entire system,
that The Carver?

42
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,051
We should get him if we can.

43
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:08,721
(SIGHING)

44
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:14,482
Okay, we can talk to the guy, but, I
mean, he's really gonna have to sell me.

45
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,406
JARED: Six months ago,
these guys had $35 million

46
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,811
and Series B financing.

47
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:28,884
Now The Carver's here doing teardown.

48
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,321
He's basically moving their carcass
to the cloud.

49
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:34,324
ERLICH: Don't touch anything.
Failure is contagious.

50
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,410
I think that's him.

51
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,285
(TYPING)

52
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:46,330
Excuse me, Mr. Carver?

53
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:51,490
(SNICKERING) Yeah, uh, people refer to me
as The Carver,

54
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:55,007
but no one actually calls me that.
It's, uh, what people call a screen name.

55
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,606
You know. I'm Kevin.

56
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,765
Okay, Kevin, um, we're from Pied Piper,
we spoke earlier.

57
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,366
- Yeah, so you guys are fucked, huh?
- No. No, we're not fucked.

58
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,805
Yes, we are totally fucked.

59
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:08,201
We have a live demo in one week
and our cloud is in the shitter.

60
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,521
- That's accurate.
- Wait, are you Richard?

61
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:12,891
Yes, I am.

62
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,045
Yeah, your, uh, algorithm is solid.
It's a really good schema.

63
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:18,849
Okay, thanks.

64
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,362
I did think you'd be younger.
What are you, 25?

65
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,646
I'm 26.

66
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,926
Yikes.

67
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,689
Uh, so I have a Model UN thing on Monday,

68
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,127
but maybe I could burn through your gig
over the weekend.

69
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,649
Mmm. You think you can do our whole job
in two days?

70
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,961
I know I can do it in two days.

71
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,522
I pound Mello Yello, Oreos and Adderall
and I don't sleep until I'm done.

72
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:44,768
- Okay.
- (SCOFFING)

73
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,171
But you know what? I also have an offer

74
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,844
to do some migration at Gittawonk
this weekend.

75
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:52,164
It's, uh... It's kind of chill, and
frankly, their tech's a little stronger.

76
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,322
Whoa. What? What?

77
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:56,927
You think Gittawonk's tech
is stronger than ours?

78
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,651
I'm sorry, I don't remember reading
in PandoDaily

79
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,764
that Gavin Belson and Peter Gregory
were fighting over Gittawonk.

80
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:06,083
No one offered $10 million
to acquire Gittawonk.

81
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,403
Yeah, I agree with Richard,
you should come work for us.

82
00:04:09,480 --> 00:04:11,960
- What... No...
- What's it gonna take, a blow-job?

83
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:14,771
Because Richard will suck the
dick right off of your pelvis.

84
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:15,966
(LAUGHING)

85
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:21,083
Now, you make me laugh, shaggy man.

86
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,128
All right, I'm in. I'll
see you guys Friday.

87
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,161
(TYPING)

88
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,651
RICHARD: Okay.

89
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,521
- (WHISPERING) Well done.
- (WHISPERING) Yeah.

90
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,964
Excuse me.
Hi, um, would you guys be interested

91
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,725
in buying some candy so you can
send my church group to camp?

92
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,887
Nope.

93
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:42,846
RICHARD: Erlich, come on.

94
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:44,570
ERLICH: $100 says there's no church.

95
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,409
Whole thing's a scam, little scumbags.

96
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,970
They're just children.

97
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,964
Looks like Gilfoyle and his lady Satanist
are back from the airport.

98
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,361
Can you imagine what kind
of shit-show this one's gonna be?

99
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:55,847
He says that she has an Amy Winehouse vibe.

100
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:58,400
What does that mean?
All tatted-up and nowhere to go?

101
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:01,131
- Hooked on OxyContin?
- Decomposing?

102
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:03,726
Oh. Oh, okay, that was dark.

103
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,566
Gentlemen, this is Tara.

104
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:11,369
- Hey.
- Tara, this is the fellas.

105
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,522
Jared, Dinesh, (MISPRONOUNCING)
Erlich and Richard.

106
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:16,171
- It's Erlich.
- Oh, it's great to finally meet you guys.

107
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,001
Hi.

108
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,641
- (TARA GIGGLING)
- GILFOYLE: All right.

109
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,807
Hmm.

110
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:26,684
Jesus, where did he
get Amy Winehouse from?

111
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:30,765
I mean, I'd have sex with that
if you hose the Gilfoyle off of her.

112
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,401
It's weird having a girl in the house.
There's a very strange energy.

113
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,161
Hmm.

114
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,728
Hello... Kevin.

115
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:51,846
(CHUCKLING) Okay, Richard,
I just need you to approve Kevin's fee.

116
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,367
I got Erlich to sign
and you just sign right there.

117
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:58,011
$20,000 for two days.

118
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,881
You know who else thought
my price was too high?

119
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,088
- BitRaptor.
- Who?

120
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:05,806
Exactly.

121
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,331
Great. Peter Gregory is on his way out
of town so I'm gonna hustle out there

122
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,970
and get him to co-sign these

123
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:15,008
and the check,
and I'll be back as soon as I can.

124
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,367
- Well, go.
- Thank you.

125
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,122
You okay over there?
You have any questions...

126
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:24,567
Yeah, one question.

127
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:25,880
Cool. Shoot.

128
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,884
Why do you keep your lips
pressed so tight together

129
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,007
when you're not talking?

130
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,564
'Cause they're like white.

131
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,640
It looks uncomfortable.

132
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,041

Hey, guys.

136
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:55,490
Hey, Kevin, um,

137
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:59,161
so how did you bypass
Bank of America's network security?

138
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,521
I want details.

139
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,084
My lawyers told me
I'm not allowed to discuss it.

140
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,362
Totally get it. That's baller.

141
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:29,361
- Hey, babe? You're up.
- Hmm.

- GILFOYLE: Mmm-hmm.

144
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,282
- Uh, what was that?
- What?

145
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,802
Tara just whispered something to you
and then she looked at me in a weird way.

146
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,641
No, she didn't.

147
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,321
Yeah, she did.

148
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,845
What's up?

149
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,684
Do you know what compression is?

150
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,161
It's when someone takes pleasure
in seeing their loved one gratified

151
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,605
by another person.

152
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,609
Sexually. It's the opposite of jealousy.

153
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:24,566
It sounds like it's the opposite of normal.
Why are you telling me about this thing?

154
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:27,927
(CLEARING THROAT) As shocking as this is...

155
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,727
Tara is attracted to you.

00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,766
Come again?

157
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:39,322
Yeah, freaked me out, too, at first.

158
00:08:39,800 --> 00:08:42,406
I don't like the "at first" part at all.

What are you saying?

160
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,768
Since I abide by the maxim,

next to you when you're in your towel.

164

I don't want to have a threesome with you.

I'm not talking about a threesome.

166
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,883

Right, so we're all settled then?

169
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:11,362
- Yep.
- Do you need parking validation?

170
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,329
No, I, uh, used Lyft.

171
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,568
So I'll Lyft it back.

172
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:17,369
Why don't I have Peter's car take you home?

173
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,568
He's not using it,
we're shipping off to Arallon tomorrow.

00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:22,803
- Arallon?
- Yeah, the island Peter's building.

That's the International Date Line.

The island's built right on it

178
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:34,166
so the western half can celebrate
the first New Year's on Earth,

179
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,402
then the next day,
they walk over to the eastern half

180
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:38,323
and celebrate the last New Year's on Earth.

181
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,120
But if you can walk,
why does he need the car on the island?

182
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:44,050
Peter's not really big on walking.

183

pull it up front for you.

00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:13,681
You look ridiculous.

313
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:16,650
Hail Satan, it is done.

314
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,640
- ALL: Hail Satan.
- ERLICH: Hail Satan, it is...

315
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:20,886
It's done.

316
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,601
Well, thanks for coming, everyone.

317
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:30,969
Brother Jason was kind enough
to furnish this week's food.

318
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,088
It's Chick-fil-A.

319
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:35,527
I know, they're on the Christian right,

320
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,689
but darned if that chicken isn't good.

321
00:16:38,760 --> 00:16:41,081
- I think the Dark Lord would understand.

322
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,041
- Also... Ugh. A reminder.
- (WOMAN CHUCKLING)

323
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:47,363
If you parked in the Sav-On parking lot,

324
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,204
they do tow.

325
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:53,603
Well, I didn't know if you wanted
original Oreos or Double Stuf

326
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:55,603
so I went a little nutty and I got both.

327
00:16:56,080 --> 00:16:57,366
How's it, um...

328
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,727
- KEVIN: Fuck. Fuck.
- (SIGHS)

329
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,325
- Kevin?

330
00:17:02,280 --> 00:17:03,566
Hello?

331
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,091
(WHIMPERING) Fuck.

332
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:09,049
What are you doing down here?

333
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:12,522
I did it again, I did it again.

334
00:17:12,600 --> 00:17:14,284
- Did what?
- I did it again.

335
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:17,171
KEVIN: (MUMBLING) No.

336
00:17:18,200 --> 00:17:19,531
What is this?

337
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,767
Did you overwrite the data schema?

338
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,921
Why would you do this?
You don't ever do this!

339
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,571
That's exactly what they said
when I was working at BofA.

340
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,042
Working at BofA? I thought you hacked in.

341
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,167
KEVIN: No.

342
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:37,569
I was a consultant
at the retail banking services.

343
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,290
I crashed their entire system.

344
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:41,966
It took a team of seven engineers
more than a week

345
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,367
to comb through all the code
and find my mistake.

346
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,602
And the only way that
I ever avoided being sued

347
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,968
was by agreeing to never tell anyone
that I worked there.

348
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,285
Oh, fuck.

349
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:55,010
Oh, fuck, what?

350
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,323
I just told you. Now I
could get in trouble.

351
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,080
Trouble?

352
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,561
You just skull-fucked my whole system.

353
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:04,280
I am going to punch you in the fucking...

354
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,641
We don't like sacrifice goats or anything.

355
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,961
We're not like
the Order of the Golden Dawners, you know.

356
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,002
- ERLICH: Yeah.
- (TARA CHUCKLING)

357
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,010
Richard, are you okay?

358
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:15,088
Um... Mmm...

359
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,647
Dinesh, uh, we may have a slight problem.

360
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:22,441
The Carver just carved
up our entire platform.

361
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,360
What the fuck?

362
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,727
Yeah, the database layers,
the application layers,

363
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,609
even the chef scripts are fucked.

364
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:31,809
The little fucker must have hacked
into the DDL tables like he did with BofA.

365
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:35,288
He didn't hack into BofA.
He was consulting there at the time,

366
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,601
when he took down the system by accident.

367
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,802
- KEVIN: Oh, you told them too?
- What the fuck?

368
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:43,771
Richard, why would you let that
little fetus access the DDL?

369
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:47,322
Because I thought
that fetus was better than me

370
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,004
and so did you and everybody

371
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,287
and you just, you pressured me
into hiring him...

372
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,971
Yes, Richard, for the cloud,
to deploy the cloud.

373
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,769
So that you could do what you do best

374
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,526
and concentrate on everything else
which the fetus just fucked up.

375
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,284
You need to drag this little shit stain...

376
00:19:01,360 --> 00:19:02,486
You hear that?
(BANGING ON TABLE)

377
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,130
out from under this table
and have him go through

378
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,929
every single line of code with you

379
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,247
to unfuck it while it's still unfuckable.

380
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,601
I should not have eaten
all of that Satanist chicken.

381
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:18,490
RICHARD: Okay, and with this one here,
did you delete it

382
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,925
or just move it?

383
00:19:21,800 --> 00:19:24,201
Hello? Kevin.

384
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,850
Maybe. I don't know.

385
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:28,924
What? What does that mean?
What's wrong with you, man?

386
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,890
I can't focus. I'm out of Adderall.

387
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,561
Where's that Jared guy?
He was getting my refill.

388
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,484
That's actually a really good question.

389
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,925
I don't know where he is.

390
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,923
(JARED SINGING SOFTLY)

391
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:53,801
The Carver's Adderall prescription.
I hope that's not a problem.

392
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,451
- (PHONE BEEPING)
- Dead battery.

393
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:57,601
That's a problem.

394
00:19:58,120 --> 00:19:59,531
I need to lay down.

395
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,125
What? No! (SCOFFING)

396
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,168
You said you could code
for 48 hours straight.

397
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,401
That's like your thing.

398
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:07,086
Yeah, how the fuck do you think I do that?
Adderall.

399
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,003
Well, we don't have any.

400
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,610
It's really bright in here.

401
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:13,604
Who takes Adderall anymore?

402
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:16,282
KEVIN: Half the kids in Palo Alto.

403
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:20,491
Hey-

404
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:25,210
Any of you guys currently on Adderall

405
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:29,444
and, uh, you know, want to make $50?

406
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,011
(EXHALING) Oh, boy.

407
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,803
What do you mean, it's not Adderall?
It's Adderall!

408
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:01,360
I know what Adderall looks like.
It's not Adderall.

409
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,921
(SIGHING)

410
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,441
Uh...

411
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:11,522
Excuse me. Caleb?

412
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,522
There's been some kind of mistake.

413
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:18,446
What you sold me was not actually Adderall.

414
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,760
So maybe we could...

415
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,882
Do you think you could get me
some real Adderall?

416
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,405
Yeah, yeah, of course.

417
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:24,801
Um...

418
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,405
I could do that or, um...

419
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,369
I can give you some of this.

420
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,010
- Ow!
- (CHILDREN LAUGHING)

421
00:21:31,080 --> 00:21:32,445
Okay, I'm gonna...

422
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,370
You're gonna do what, bitch?
Call the cops on me?

423
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:38,290
Tell them you got the wrong
illegal drugs from a kid?

424
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,165
You dumb piece of shit.
Get the fuck out of here.

425
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:42,890
- Uh, you...
- Run!

426
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,247
- All right, I'm running.
- Keep running!

427
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,569
Stupid... (GROANING)

428
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,363
Richard, what's wrong?

429
00:22:32,600 --> 00:22:34,284
Have you been crying?

430
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:37,161
Hey! Which one was it?

431
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,164
It was Church Candy, wasn't it?

432
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,129
You just brought piss to a shit fight,
you little cunt!

433
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,361
Ow!

434
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,041
(GROANING)

435
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,929
CALEB: No, no, no!

436
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,209
Now you get in your fucking house
and you get me five Adderall

437
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,521
or I'll slit your fucking throat!
You understand?

438
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,722
I'll kill your mother!
I'll rape your father!

439
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,121
I'll curb-stomp that little face so hard

440
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,931
that your teeth will go
flying, you little shit!

441
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,365
Now go! Go! Go! Go!

442
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,000
- Get me five Adderall, right now!
- Okay! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

443
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,210
- Hi.
- Tara.

444
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:21,684
- Hello.
- Hi.

445
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,005
First of all...

446
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,450
So, um...

447
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,803
I have thought about it. A lot.

448
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,363
To be honest, elements of this arrangement
still trouble me.

449
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:43,961
However, I have not had
a lot of sexual experiences.

450
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:48,170
So I feel it may be foolish
to turn this down.

451
00:23:49,880 --> 00:23:54,647
So as long as Gilfoyle is not in the room

452
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:58,202
and I can verify that the door is locked

453
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,441
then I have concluded that,

454
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,362
yes,

455
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:11,526
I would love to have
sexual relations with you,

456
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,001
Tara.

457
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:16,521
Yeah.

458
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,201
Uh, what are you talking about?

459
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,371
Gilfoyle told me.

460
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,328
I know you want to have sex with me.

461
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,246
Gilfoyle?

462
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,842
Would you come in here for a second?

463
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:31,481
Um...

464
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,880
Um... (SNICKERING)

465
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:37,042
Did you tell Dinesh that
I want to have sex with him?

466
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:40,561
No.

467
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,765
Oh, wait, yeah, I totally did.
I forgot about that.

468
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:46,808
I was really high. I was
just fucking with him.

469
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:47,967
Did he believe me?

470
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,841
Uh...

471
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:52,048
Did you just present yourself to my woman?

472
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:53,121
(STAMMERING) Uh...

473
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,204
Oh, this is outstanding.

474
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,608
Oh, my God, that is so mean of you!

475
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,609
Look at how cute he is.

476
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,929
He's adorable. You're adorable.

477
00:25:05,000 --> 00:25:09,085
Don't call me... It's very emasculating.

478
00:25:10,760 --> 00:25:13,684
What kind of fucking idiot
listens to what Gilfoyle has to say?

479
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,048
Okay, Tara, here's what it is.

480
00:25:17,160 --> 00:25:19,208
If you can tell me to my face

481
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:21,851
that you seriously find Dinesh
more attractive than me,

482
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:24,605
then and only then will I concede defeat.

483
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,281
What?

484
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,723
And our regression test is...

485
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:39,847
- (BEEPS)
- Done.

486
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,890
Yes. It's clear, we all test out.

488
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:46,088
- The system's stable again.
- Thank God.

489
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:49,130
Now we can move on to the next module
and I can forget you ever existed.

490
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,567
Can you do me a favor?

491
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:55,121
Don't tell anyone I cratered this bad.

492
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:58,360
I won't tell anyone I hired you
if you won't tell anyone you worked here.

493
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:01,564
Oh, the BofA deal. Got it.

(KEVIN SIGHS)

495
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,010
Well, I'm gonna call my mom
and have her pick me up.

496
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:06,570
Your mom?

497
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,927
Oh, by the way, you owe me $20,000.

498
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,765
What a dick.

499
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:14,648
You have to talk to Jared about that.

500
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,006
Where is Jared?

501
