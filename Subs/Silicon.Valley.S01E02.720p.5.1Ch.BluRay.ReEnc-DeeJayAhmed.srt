He works for Gavin Belson.

Hey. Sorry if I scared you.

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,882
I know I have somewhat ghost-like features.

My uncle used to say, "You look like
someone starved a virgin to death."

It's... Yeah. I can see it.

- Mmm-hmm.

I heard you were having a launch party.

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:45,682
- Yeah.
- Am I early?

No.

you should know that I've turned him down.

I'm going with Peter Gregory.

I'm actually picking up my check tomorrow.

19
00:00:58,560 --> 00:00:59,846
So I've made my decision.

very exciting about that.

Whoa. Whoa, whoa! What is he doing here?

Hey, this is a private party, buddy.
I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

I really respect what you're doing here.

And if you could ever use someone
with my business-development skill set,

We'll call you when we want pleated khakis.

You know this is a fucking domestic?

34
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:46,204
Why were you so mean to him?

35
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:48,567
He wasn't spying on us.
He just said he likes us.

36
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,768

- Of course he does, Richard.

Your whole life you've been an ugly chick,

Okay. There's the butt time.

Should we go back in there?

Who was this woman that you shook
hands with for the first time?

The postman lady.

96
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:32,128
- What?
- A woman that was a man?

97
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:34,328
Not a post-man lady.

98
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:36,607
- A lady who was a post...
- Let me ask you another question.

99
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:38,648
Who was the second woman
you shook hands with?

100

BIG HEAD: I didn't even know
you were coming.

- MOCHACINO: Stop. Doug!
- Oh, boy.

102
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,041
- Stop.
- I'm the one...

103
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,122
Someone is paying me. Okay? I didn't come

104
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,487
just to dance on your
boner all night for free.

105
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:50,962
I was not erect. That was...
I was only being polite.

106
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,690
So you were being polite when
you said that you loved me?

107
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,525
First off, I said you seemed
like someone I could fall in love with.

108
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,204
And, yes, also politeness.

109
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,686
Richie, pay the lady.

110
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,328
What? Why should I pay her?

111
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,360
I didn't hire her. I didn't
even get a lap dance.

112
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,641
This is a company party
and you're the CEO, so pony up.

113
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:07,882
No. If anyone should pay her,
it should be you.

114
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,960
Doug, help the CEO find his money.

115
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,367
No. No, no. We don't need help.

116
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:14,680
I know where it is. It's here.

117
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,120
- It's all here.
- MOCHACINO: Mmm-hmm.

00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,725
I don't know... Do you accept AMEX?

119
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,531
- You damn right I do.
- Put 100 on there for yourself, Mocha.

120
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,364
Oh. Well, that's an expensive boner.

121
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,441
Not a boner.

122
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,730
Thanks for coming in, guys.

123
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,768
We have a lot to do, so let's get started.

124
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,361
Sounds great.

125
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,651

126
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,081
Uh...

to get going, Mr. Gregory.

Yes. Who-S "We"?

Myself, him,

130
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,322
- uh, the guys back at the house.
- Guys?

131
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,966
What guys?

132
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:03,445
Who is this?

133
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,802
Erlich Bachman. I'm an entrepreneur,

134
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,126

Uh...

Richard actually developed Pied Piper

137

while residing in my incubator,

138
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,761
so as per our agreement,
I own 10% of the company.

139
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,168
I'm paying you $200,000 for 5%,

140
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,480
yet you're giving this man

141
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,447
twice that in exchange for a futon

142
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,963
and some sandwiches?

143
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,886
Actually, sir, my tenants
provide their own food.

144
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,680

have you apportioned?

00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,729
you may have prepared?

00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,249
I just was under the impression that

149
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:47,769
we would just be coming by
and saying, "Hi," you know, uh,

00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,445
to pick up the check.

151
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,643
And I just didn't know that
any of that stuff was due yet.

152
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:53,847
"Due"?

153
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,841
(LAUGHS)

154
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:58,724
This is not college, Richard.

155
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,610
I am not going to be
giving you a course syllabus.

156
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,686
You turned down $10 million
to keep Pied Piper.

157
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:09,965
What did you give up that money for?
What is this company?

158
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:12,160
What did I buy?

159
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:14,726
- You bought the algorithm, which...
- No.

160
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,443
The algorithm is the
product of the company.

161
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:20,487
I know that.

162
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,086
What I'm asking about
is the company itself.

163
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:25,481
Who is it? What do they do?

164
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,331
Are they essential?

165
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,968
Or do you just throw a percentage at them,
like you did with this...

166
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,762
This all must be worked out.

167
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,241
Now.

168
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,921
When you said you'd guide us

169
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,048
through some of this stuff,
I thought that this was

170
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,770
the stuff you'd be guiding us through.

171
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,567
I cannot guide you until you give me

172
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,882
something to guide.

173
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,084
This is going very poorly.

174
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:04,404
- I know.
- He doesn't seem to know what he's doing.

175
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,362
Did you just take a sip from an empty cup?

176
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:13,681
Yes.

177
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,921
Why did you do that?

178
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,403
- Just something to do.
- Come back in 48 hours

179
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,164
with an airtight business plan,

180
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,481
a clear go-to-market strategy,

181
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:27,891
and three-year summary P&L,
or there will be no check.

182
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,726
That's it.

183
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,283
MONICA: Thanks for coming in, guys.

184
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,401
Um...

185
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:41,801
Are there any water
fountains in your offices?

186
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,761
I assume.

187
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:47,447
I own 10% of an app
that locates all nearby water fountains.

188
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,840
I'd be happy to discuss it with you.

189
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,649
Good day, gentlemen.

190
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:53,001
You smoke weed?

191
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,366
You really embarrassed me in there.

192
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,966
You didn't say shit about
any business plan before today.

193
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,681
And neither did he. And he was
kind of being an asshole back there.

194
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,051
Yeah, that's why he's a billionaire.

195
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,921
'Cause he knows how
and when to be an asshole.

196
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,001
That's what you need to be like.

197
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:10,889
- You do, Richard.
- Whatever.

198
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:14,646
If you continue to mismanage this company,
giving 10% to whoever...

199
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,041
Obviously, you know,
we can't go back on my shares.

200
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,367
That ship has sailed,
but from here on out...

201
00:09:19,520 --> 00:09:21,170
Now you're being an asshole.

202
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,810
You say that like it's a bad thing.

203
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:25,247
Richard, if you're not an asshole,
it creates this kind of

204
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,723
asshole vacuum and that void
is filled by other assholes, like Jared.

205
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,484
I mean, you almost gave him shares.

206
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,766
You need to completely
change who you are, Richard.

207
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,207
A complete Teutonic shift has to happen.

208
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,321
- Tectonic.
- What?

209
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,849
A "tectonic" shift is
the Earth's crust moving around.

210
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,082
"Teutonic," which is what you just said,

211
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,891
is an ancient Germanic tribe
that fought the Romans.

212
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,611
They were originally from Scandinavia...

213
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,603
Stop it! Stop it.

214
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:56,602
You're being a complete tool right now.

215
00:09:56,760 --> 00:09:59,047
I need you to be a complete asshole.

216
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:00,881
Do you understand the difference?

217
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,002
If you're not an asshole,
this company dies.

218
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,289
Erlich, I have 48 hours.

219
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,601
Are you going to help me
with this business plan or not?

220
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:11,283
I believe in you, Richard.
That's why I'm not.

Hi, this is Richard Hendricks.

226
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,290
Is now a good time?

227
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,125
Uh, I need some help.

Jared Dunn's.

00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,242
What? Why? Why is he here?

231
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:56,081
Well, because, as you know,
I need some advice on the business plan.

232
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,401
You're cutting him in?

233
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,561
Um...

234
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,961
Good morning. Whoops, that was weird.

235
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,889
I don't know why I did that.

236
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,085
You kind of have a...
Like a king-ish feeling to you.

237
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,925
You're like a Norse hero from Valhalla.

238
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,207
Don't pander to me.

239
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,766
Peter Gregory said
specifically to trim the fat.

240
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,606
They actually tried to diagnose me
with a wasting disease

241
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:22,364
because of my slender frame.

242
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,282
So, um, I ironed out
our customer acquisition strategy,

243
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,331
and I wrapped our financials.
I did a DCF valuation.

244
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:35,246
Most VCs can't even do that math,
but something tells me Peter is different.

245
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:38,440
I think we can jump into
the one-on-ones with each team member

246
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,602
- to see if I can defend our cap table.
- Okay.

247
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:44,050
But first, if you don't mind,
I'd like to use the restroom.

248
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:46,971
Uh, yeah. You don't have to
ask permission to do that.

249
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,883
Why, have you not gone
since you've been here?

250
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,167
I have not.

251
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,921
Well... Well, go. I mean, go.

Please, have a seat.

255

I'm not sitting this summer.

00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,726
Of course. Incredible.

What's weighing on you, Gavin?

00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,481
Jared Dunn quit today to join Pied Piper.

But in the hands of the enlightened,

We know it's kind of a little weird.

274
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:12,327
So, um, can you kind of catch me up on
what you see as your role in the company?

275
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,246
- What do you do?
- What do I do?

276
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:20,565
System architecture.
Networking and security.

277
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:23,609
No one in this house can touch me on that.

278

Okay, that's good to know.

But does anyone appreciate that?

minoring in gender studies

and singing a capella at Sarah Lawrence,

282

I was gaining root access to NSA servers.

I was one click away
from starting a second Iranian Revolution.

284
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,086
I actually went to Vassar.

285
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:43,767
I prevent cross-site scripting.
I monitor for DDOS attacks,

and faulty transaction handlings.

297
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,651
I make sure that one bad config
on one key component

298
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:17,722
doesn't bankrupt the
entire fucking company.

That's what the fuck I do.

Um, that's basically what I told him.

Listen, wherever we end up here,

302
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:29,283
I just wanna say that I feel
I should get more equity than Dinesh.

303
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,007
I know Gilfoyle probably
came in here and puked out

304
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,241

305
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,005
three-fourths of which
are total horse-shit.

306

Did he bring up the
Iranian Revolution thing?

307
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,770
Yeah, those words mean nothing.

308
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,405
But here's a fact,

309
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:45,086
I'm the only one of these clowns
that can code in Java.

310
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,131
And I write sleek, performant,
low-overhead Scala code

311
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,164
with higher order functions
that will run on anything.

312
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,602
Period. End of sentence.

313
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:56,684
So, basically, I think
whatever equity I get,

314
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,811
it should reflect that
I contribute more than Gilfoyle.

315
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,730
- This is weird.
- I know, right? It's...

316
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:07,161
- Everybody's been doing it.
- Gilfoyle did this?

317
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,801
It's just a formality to get me caught up.

318
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,846
So what makes you of value
to the Pied Piper team?

319
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:14,921
Um...

320
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,401
Programming, I guess.

321
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:21,646
Pretty good at code,
develop algorithms, so forth.

322
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,530
Different from the type of
algorithm Richard created?

323
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,002
Well, yeah. Like, not as good.

324
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,127
Richard's a 10X-er. I'm,
like, barely an X-er.

325
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,566
(BOTH LAUGHING)

326
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,001
I kinda suck.

327
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,041
- (MAN IN GAME GROANS)
- Smoked you. And now...

328
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:37,887
- Don't be a dick.
- Mushroom stamp!

329
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:41,368
- You're being a dick.
- Oh, there you go. Show that to your mom.

330
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,131
Mushroom stamp! That's great.

331
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,809
Hey, what do you guys
think about this Jared?

332
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,881
He's shit, right?

333
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,521
No, he's pretty sharp.

334
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:53,001
Yeah, he does shit that
no one else in the house can do.

335
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,960
Yeah, but he's a know-it-all.
I don't think there's room in here for him.

336
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,082
Well, there will be
after Richard gets rid of Big Head.

337
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,128
Wait, Richard's getting
rid of Big Head? Why?

338
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,810
Listen, we all love Big Head.

339
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,247
But the truth is, he's not
as good of a coder as I am,

340
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:06,161
not as good at system architecture
as Gilfoyle,

341
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:09,171
not as good at being a prick as you,
no offense.

342
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:11,720
He's a lightweight at everything.
Brings nothing to the table.

343
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:15,324
Him getting points would be
a big "fuck you" to all of us.

344
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:19,765
- But he's a great guy.
- Great guy. But useless.

345
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,562
Yeah, he is a great guy.

346
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,243
Not like that Jared. Huh.

347
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,529
At least we can all agree on that.

348
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:29,891
Yeah, I don't know.

349
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:33,009
Me and Richard have just always
been in this together, you know?

350
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,201
Together, right.

351
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:37,682
But to be clear, Richard created
the algorithm on his own, yes?

352
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,601
Oh, yeah, I had nothing to do with that.

353
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:43,482
- He's my best friend.
- That's true.

354
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,564
Yes. The camaraderie is quite apparent.

355
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:51,965
But Peter Gregory demanded
a lean, ruthless business plan,

356
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,090
and I don't think that the CEO of Microsoft
has a paid best friend.

357
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:59,410
Sergey Brin does. (CHUCKLES)
Larry doesn't do shit.

358
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,481
See.

359
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,810
What if Big Head is sort of
like a floating utility player?

360
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,609
Like a jack of all trades.

361
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:12,569
But, by his own admission,
he's really more like a master of none.

362
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:14,284
That's true. That is true.

363
00:17:14,360 --> 00:17:17,409
Which is not something
you'd generally reward with several points

364
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:21,007
in what may someday be
a multi-billion dollar company.

365
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:23,283
This will never fly with Peter Gregory.

366
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:28,051
I would not want to be Richard right now.

367
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:30,122
Having to tell Big Head that he's out.

368
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,201
DINESH: This is gonna sound super mean,

369
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,726
but the other night he was sleeping,
I was just staring at his face.

370
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:38,168
All I could think was,
"He's utterly useless.

371
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,721
"Big Head is a man with zero purpose."

372
00:17:40,800 --> 00:17:42,086
(JARED CLEARS THROAT)

373
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:46,801
- Oh, hi. Hi, Big Head.
- Hey.

374
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,961
How's it going?

375
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:51,331
It's super good right now.

376
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:54,643
Um, I'm just going to maybe
go for a bike ride real fast

377
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:58,084
and clear my... head.

378
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,004
I'll see you.

379
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:02,005
- Bike safe.
- Yeah, enjoy it.

380
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,686
That was nice, guys. He heard everything.

381
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,285
That doesn't make it not true.

382
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:09,284
I mean, come on, Richard.
As far as Pied Piper is concerned,

383
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,846
he's as pointless as Mass <i>Effect</i> 3's
multiple endings.

384
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:15,527
I mean, he's a completely useless
appendage, and we all know it.

385
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,920
- Oh, hey, man.
- Forgot my water bottle.

386
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:29,041
Just gonna grab it, and then probably
walk right back through one more time.

387
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,409
<i>I mean, Mass Effect 3?</i>

388
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,121
Harsh.

389
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:36,129
I didn't mean for him to hear it,
but it was true.

390
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,727
I mean, we all called him a great guy,
but he didn't overhear any of that.

391
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,884
RICHARD: (GROANS) It's been 12 hours.

392
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,283
God damn. He's still not answering.

393
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,721
You know...
I'm actually kind of worried about him.

394
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:52,407
You know, if he's gone,
like, really, truly gone,

395
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:55,360
in a way that kind of solves your problem.

396
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,125
I mean, like, if he's dead...

397
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:59,322
Are you trying to say
that Big Head might be dead?

398
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:01,323
That doesn't help at all.
How is that helping?

399
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,404
I'm just saying that that's a possible
thing that could've happened to him.

400
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,766
It could happen to anybody.

401
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,128
And in this case, at least
something good came out of it.

402
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,440
What's the good part?

403
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:12,409
You don't have to have
an awkward conversation.

404
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:14,608
That's scary. Should we go look for him?

405
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:18,048
I mean, I agree with these guys.
Jared's just not working out.

406
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:19,567
What?

407
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,326
Um, Richard...

408
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,207
I don't wanna be too assertive here,

409
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,250
but I could use your input
on a few things for the business plan.

410
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,971
Richie, you tried your best.
Just call him, leave a message,

411
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,121
say he's out.

412
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,804
No, that's an asshole move.

413
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:35,850
Yeah, remember? You need to be an asshole.

414
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,770
I feel bad about saying that thing
about him being dead.

415
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,001
That's not who I am.

416
00:19:41,560 --> 00:19:42,561
(ALARM BEEPING)

417
00:19:44,360 --> 00:19:46,727
- Wait, what is that?
- That's impossible.

418
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:49,451
NipAlert isn't live yet.

419
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:51,090
Maybe he's demoing it for someone.

420
00:19:52,760 --> 00:19:54,524
"Mochacino."

421
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,001
He rode his bike to San Jose?

422
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,286
Jared, can I borrow your car?

423
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,203
- Sure.
- I have a car.

424
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,203
What's wrong with my car?

425
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,770
I just have... I don't know.

426
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:06,282
All right, well, remember to be an asshole.

427
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:07,841
(DOOR CLOSES)

428
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,801
A real asshole.

429
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,922
Hi, I'm Richard Hendricks.
You did a dance... The dancing at my house.

430
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,724
Your ride's here.

431
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,371
Oh, hey, man.

432
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:26,164
- Hey.
- Mushroom stamp!

433
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,966
No, come on, dude, not again... (GROANS)

434
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,561
I just wanted to work with
computers and get paid for it.

435
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:37,122
I didn't want end up fighting with
my roommates over percentage points.

436
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:38,486
So you're just gonna give up?

437
00:20:38,560 --> 00:20:41,370
On what? This isn't home.

438
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,602
As much as I've tried, it's just not.

439
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,209
I mean, what would I have even done
if I didn't have Mochacino's card?

440
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,770
Where would I have gone?

441
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:51,124
It's fucking pathetic.

442
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,602
Well, Mochacino seemed to like you.
She let you into her apartment.

443
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,409
I had to give her my bike.

444
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,608
She's just like everyone else
in this goddamn valley.

445
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:01,843
Watching the bottom line.
Fuck it, dude. I'm done here.

446
00:21:02,360 --> 00:21:03,486
What about NipAlert?

447
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,802
Mochacino shows her tits for a living,
and even she was uncomfortable using it.

448
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:13,124
She said it was sexist.
She's right. It's actually perverted.

449
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,608
I made a perverted, sexist, useless thing.

450
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:21,281
And, you know, everybody's right, man,

451
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,442
there's nothing for me to do on Pied Piper.

452
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:27,009
I think over time,
maybe we could redefine your role.

453
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,360
Come on, dude.

454
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:31,640
Unless you can tell me right now
what I can do for Pied Piper

455
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:34,570
that no one else can, I'm gone.

456
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,611
- Yeah.
- Uh...

457
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:42,851
I'm going to go get the stuff
out of my cube at Hooli,

458
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:45,571
and then I'm getting the
hell out of this town.

459
00:21:49,280 --> 00:21:50,611
So this is goodbye then?

460
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,323
I mean, I'll see you
back at the house, man.

461
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:57,323
I gotta, like, pack and stuff.

462
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,481
Oh, totally.

463
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,924
I'm going to take the train, I think,
just do some thinking...

464
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,570
Okay. All right, see you.

465
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,411
- The train is this way... I just...
- Oh. I was gonna say.

466
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:09,966
Big Head.

467
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,284
Whatever shit you're about to dump
on my head, you can save it, okay?

468
00:22:14,360 --> 00:22:15,407
I'm not in the mood.

469
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,284
Dude, I just wanted to tell you
that Gavin Belson

470
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,521
wants to talk to you about something.

471
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:21,803
- Oh, okay. Fuck you.
- No. Seriously.

472
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,767
Gavin Belson said he wants
to speak to Nelson Bighetti?

473
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:28,042
Yeah, that's what I just said.

474
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:30,766
Come on.

475
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,120
Okay...

476
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:41,451
I'm awake! I'm awake.

477
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,927
- What?
- No, no, I wasn't.

478
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:49,364
I was sleeping. I'm sorry for sleeping
and for lying about it.

479
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,329
For both. No good.

480
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:52,881
What happened?

481
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:54,881
Did you fire Big Head?

482
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,521
Uh, no. Not yet. I don't know. Sort of.

483
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:00,530
So, um, do I include him
in the cap table or not?

484
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,931
It's basically good to go.

485
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,201
Uh, no, he's out. Wait... I don't know.

486
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,210
Actually, I just need to close
my eyes for a little bit. Okay?

487
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,363
Richard, it's T-minus four hours
until presentation time.

488
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,085
Are you gonna fire Big Head or not?

489
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:15,650
I don't know. Uh...

490
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,006
I'm just very tired.

491
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,401
Okay? I'm just gonna go get some water...

492
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:24,565
Richard, stop being a fucking pussy
and start being an asshole.

493
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,640
Fine! You want me to be an asshole,
I'll be an asshole.

494
00:23:35,720 --> 00:23:38,724
I'll be an asshole to you
and you and you and you

495
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,245
and Peter-fucking-Gregory!

496
00:23:40,680 --> 00:23:43,524
Okay? Fuck all of you. Big Head stays!

497
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:46,611
You know, if I wanted to be a sell out,
I'd have done that already.

498
00:23:46,680 --> 00:23:49,490
I'd be on a beach somewhere
with $10 million in my pocket.

499
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,530
Not in my pocket, in a bank account.

500
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:56,401
Okay? This is my company.
It was my idea, and we do what I say.

501
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,684
And what I say is, Jared,
put Big Head in the business plan.

502
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:01,570
He gets the same amount of
shares as everybody else.

503
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:04,206
Big Head, you're not going home, man.

504
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,648
Uh, you're right. I'm not.

505
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,804
Gavin Belson just offered me
a huge promotion

506
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:13,089
for 600 grand a year
to steal me away from you guys.

507
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:15,124
- What?
- Yeah. For revenge.

508
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,406
Because you took Jared.

509
00:24:17,680 --> 00:24:19,250
So you're like the VP of spite?

510
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,410
But you have to do me a favor, Richard,

511
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,047
if you run into Gavin ever you have to
act really upset about it, you know?

512
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:27,561
Oh, but I am upset.

513
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,971
Okay? What the fuck?

514
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,361
I kind of just went out on a limb
for you here, man.

515
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:35,401
Sorry, man, but this is huge for me.

516
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,608
I'm going to move out, get my own place.

517
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,247
In light of this new information,

518
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:42,608
who gets Big Head's equity?

519
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,290
Should I get half of his shares...

520
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:46,089
I do. I get it.

521
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,050
Okay? I get all of it!

522
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:53,323
Big Head, man,
congratulations on the job, really.

523
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,410
But if you'll excuse me,
I have to go lock down

524
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,767
a motherfucking business plan.
Jared, you're with me.

525
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,440
What an asshole.

526
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:08,730
Yeah. What an asshole.

527
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,486
Next.

528
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,884
- Hi.
- Deposit?

529
00:25:19,040 --> 00:25:20,087
Mmm-hmm.

530
00:25:24,760 --> 00:25:27,491
$200,000 from Peter Gregory?

531
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:28,761
Mmm-hmm.

532
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:31,081
- Wow.
- (CELL PHONE RINGING)

533
00:25:34,440 --> 00:25:35,441
Sorry.

534
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:38,727
Hello?

535
00:25:38,800 --> 00:25:40,928
Dude, they're taking your code apart.

536
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:42,571
- What?
- Yeah,

537
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:46,361
did you give those brogrammer guys access
to a player download or something?

538
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,970
Oh, shit.

539
00:25:48,040 --> 00:25:51,203
They probably hacked the prototype
and decompiled the compression library.

540
00:25:51,760 --> 00:25:54,161
Well, they've got it now, man.

541
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:56,726
They're gonna reverse-engineer
a version as close as they can

542
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,211
without getting sued.

543
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,760
<i>Wait, wait, are you sure about this?</i>

544
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,882
Yeah, dude, Gavin wants
to beat you to market.

545
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,930
He wants to make sure no other investor
in the Valley offers you a dime.

546
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,640
(EXHALES) That is not good.

547
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,009
They're calling it Nucleus,
whatever the fuck that means.

548
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,006
Shit. Sorry, dude, I can't be
talking to you like this. Later.

549
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:15,487
Yeah.

550
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,126
"Nucleus"?

551
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:22,729
Excuse me. This check is made out
to "Pied Piper incorporated."

552
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,121
- Do you have an SS-4?
- A what?

553
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,250
Is Pied Piper a corporation
registered with the IRS?

554
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,163
I can't deposit that
into a personal account.

I don't know.

00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,364
Is that something maybe
you could help me with?

558
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,726
No, sir.

559
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,211
Buddy, come on.

560
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:43,163
Uh-huh. Yeah, yeah.

561
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,284
- Thank you.
- Sorry. Okay.

562
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,521
Next.
