4
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,647
On behalf of the entire Disrupt conference,

5
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,442
I would like to apologize
for what happened out there this afternoon.

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,530
This man will never be
asked to judge again.

7
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,929
I've just learned he's been, uh,
fired from Oracle,

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,525
and apparently his wife left him.

9
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:32,363
Anyway, I just got a call from
your attorney, Mr. LaFlamme,

10
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:37,731
informing me that in his view, this
incident is actionable. (CLEARS THROAT)

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:41,965
Uh, and in addition to
holding TechCrunch liable for any damages,

12
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,008
which may include the loss to Pied Piper

13
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:47,721
of potentially billions
in revenue and share value, uh,

14
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,442
he may be naming me
personally in a lawsuit.

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,727
So, I would like to propose that we,
uh, put this incident behind us,

16
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,125
legally speaking, uh, by sending Pied Piper
directly through to the finals

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:07,603
of Startup Battlefield,
where you will compete for the grand prize.

18
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,248
- How does that sound?
- I think that's...

19
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:15,008
One question, uh,
regarding our hotel accommodations?

20
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,251
Barn! Am I right, guys?

21
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,966
(CHUCKLES)

22
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:28,805
I was just happy
you got punched in the face, Erlich,

23
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,566
but now I'm super happy.
I feel like I won twice.

24
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,842
I'm gonna disrupt this bathroom.

25
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,289
I don't think this couch pulls out.
I guess I'll get myself a roll-away bed.

26
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:44,321
I mean, you're welcome, guys.
I had to fuck a wife and take a punch,

27
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,721
but now we get to go
into the finals tomorrow

28
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,848
without having blown our
wad in the prelims.

29
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,966
We're trending up, boys.
We are trending up.

30
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,247
Maybe you're right.
But, uh, we should probably

31
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,721
get back down there
and check out the competition.

he can't come close to our Weissman score.

it's like a fancy car with a crappy engine.

SHAKIRA: Hola, TechCrunch!

62
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,561
I mean, they just completely

63
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,484
reverse-engineered
our entire compression engine.

64
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,130
He totally sniped us.

65
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,010
- We'll be fine.
- What?

66
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,643
They judge this contest
on viability in the marketplace.

67
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:04,402
I mean, at best,
we're a worse version of Nucleus.

68
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:07,047
I mean, they have 50 modules,
and they're all awesome.

69
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,770
We have five that barely work.

70
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:12,765
I mean, we're still having trouble compressing 3-D files.
Who's lining up to buy that?

71
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,251
Who the fuck cares?

72
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:18,644
So the platform can't handle 3-D files.
You know what, 3-D movies suck anyway.

73
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:21,650
I could actually argue this Gavin nonsense
is a positive.

74
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,721
Please don't.

75
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:25,007
We just need to really dial it up
for the big show tomorrow.

76
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:26,684
Dial what up? He just ruined us.

77
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,128
And until then, we need to do what any
animal in nature does when it's cornered,

78
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:33,568
act erratically, and blindly lash
out at everything around us.

79
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,210
I'm gonna go get in Gavin's head.

80
00:04:35,480 --> 00:04:39,451
Hey, guys, I just had a thought.
Okay, so this is it, right?

81
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:42,808
A lot of successful start-ups launched
with a different business model,

82
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,804
and when they ran into trouble,
they pivoted to something new, right?

83
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:49,771
Like lnstagram. That was a location-based
check-in service when it started,

84
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:50,887
and then they pivoted.

85
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,520
Or Chatroulette, okay,
that was social media,

86
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,685
and then they pivoted to become
a playground for the sexually monstrous.

87
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:01,488
We just need a new idea, something that
people want. Right? We can pivot, too.

88
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:05,601
- Dude, you are fucked up right now.
- Yeah, you're pinning bad.

89
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,330
Well, I'll admit, I'm sleep-challenged.

90
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:10,483
I just spent four days
trapped in a steel box out on an oil rig

91
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,050
full of robot-forklifts.

92
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,441
So, that was hard, but I'm back.

93
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:18,809
I am recovering and I am focused and we're
gonna pivot. Don't lose faith, guys.

94
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,167
All right, look at me. Look at me.
Look at me.

95
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:24,720
We've got a great name.
We've got a great team.

96
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,246
We've got a great logo,
and we've got a great name.

97
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:28,925
Now we just need an idea.

98
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,560
Let's pivot! Let's pivot!

99
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:36,602
That might be the last
time we see him alive.

100
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,843
Ah, I think I'm just gonna take a walk
and, you know, try and clear my head.

101
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:44,767
I'll see you guys back at the hotel room
and we'll figure out what to do.

102
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:48,445
We're going to be poor.

103
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:53,810
Hi! I'd like to talk to you
about a company called Pied Piper.

104
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:55,450
What does it do? Good question.

105
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,170
Maybe you can help us find an answer.

106
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,406
What if Pied Piper was an app
that could attract rodents?

107
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,925
You know, like the fairy tale?

108
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:06,368
For purposes of extermination
or to feed your pet snake.

109
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:09,284
We're not here to tell you
what to do with your rats,

110
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,522
we're here to get you rats, stat.

111
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:14,928
Would you be very interested,
somewhat interested or not interested?

112
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,721
Which one? Which one? Which one?

113
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,765
Look at them, all full of hope. Pricks.

114
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,321
GILFOYLE: Oh, look,
Kwerpy's here recruiting.

115
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,248
They just got 20 million in Series A
at a $280 million dollar valuation.

116
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,721
- Wow.
- That could have been us.

117
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:40,482
It's too bad we already have jobs,
we could easily go work there.

118
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,165
Yeah.

119
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:46,800
It'd be a real dickhead move
to bail on Richard now, right?

120
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:49,850
I mean, before we officially go under.

121
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:53,489
- Yeah. Yeah. Total dickhead move.
- Yeah. Yeah.

122
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,690
Yeah, even though it is
just a matter of days.

123
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:02,685
- And we are so close.
- DINESH: I mean, he is standing right there.

124
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:05,329
- But I'm not a dickhead.
- No. Neither am I.

125
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,840
Yep, just a couple of non-dickheads.

126
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:08,086
My dick and my head, totally separate.

127
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,925
You've heard the phrase,
"Time to pay the piper," right?

128
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,287
What if there was an app
called Pied Piper that could tell you,

129
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,160
to a statistical degree of certainty,
whether you were going to heaven or hell?

130
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,604
Very interested, somewhat interested,
not interested?

131
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,045
Which one? Which one? Which one?

132
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,646
So you made some really
over-the-top promises about Nucleus.

133
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,569
- Can you deliver?
- Absolutely.

134
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,170
For me, Kara, goodness, greatness,
these are not simply catchphrases,

135
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,527
but, in fact, really the intention of Hooli
from the beginning.

136
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:41,888
Gavin, you do not need
to dignify any of this with a response!

137
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,009
I can speak for myself.
Erlich Bachman, Pied Piper.

138
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:47,208
Was I brutally assaulted? Yes.

139
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,364
Did Gavin Belson here have
anything to do with it? Unclear.

140
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:55,367
All I know is that the rumor that
TechCrunch is all abuzz about is unproven.

141
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,210
- Wait, what rumor?
- Thank you.

142
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,601
Why would Gavin
have anything to do with this?

143
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:04,811
Unless he had some reason to be frightened
by Pied Piper and its superior technology?

144
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:09,364
This and all other Gavin Belson rumors
are unsubstantiated.

145
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,842
Okay, the alcoholism,
the sexual impropriety at work,

146
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:15,891
the impending crash of Hooli's stock...

147
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,604
(CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY)
This is the most ridiculous...

148
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,604
Exactly. So why repeat
the lascivious details,

149
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,485

We're talking about
how I didn't get to present in the prelims,

because I was too busy
getting my face pummeled

every guy in the audience.

247
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:49,930
That's a lot of jerking.

248
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:53,605
And we only have 10
minutes to present. So...

249
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:56,441
So, we're fucked, aren't we?

250

there are, what, 800 guys in that room?

251
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,929
So that's 400 times
whatever the mean jerk-time is.

252
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,929
- The what?
- DINESH: Mean jerk-time.

253
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,207
I mean, it doesn't matter,
but, hypothetically,

254
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:13,568
time is equal to 400 total jerks
at a two-dick rate.

255
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:17,767
Unless Erlich jerks off four guys at a
time, and then we can cut that in half.

256
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,411
How would he do four guys...

257
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,211
He's got two hands,
so that's two dicks at a time, right?

258
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,881
Look, you have two guys on either side
with their dicks, tip to tip,

259
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:29,362
so you're going full-length. Four, see?

00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,441
Oh...

261

GILFOYLE: Like two Shake Weights?

263
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,847
DINESH: Yeah, so what we're trying to do,
hypothetically,

264
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:39,487
is minimize time, which is 800 dudes,

265
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:43,326
multiplied by mean-jerk time,
divided by four dicks at a time.

266
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:47,769
Of course, Erlich would have to pre-sort guys
by height, so that their dicks lined up.

267
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:49,365
GILFOYLE: Not by height, technically.

268
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,007
The measurement that we're looking
for, really, is dick-to-floor.

269
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:55,682
- Call that D2F.
- DINESH: Huh.

270
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:57,366
Oh, my God.

271
00:13:57,480 --> 00:13:59,767
You know, if a guy's dick was long enough,

272
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:03,890
it would be able to reach up or down
to another guy with a different D2F.

273
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:07,487
The longer the dick,
the greater the D2F bridge,

274
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,451
but I would still be able
to jerk it off in one smooth motion.

275
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,410
I would just have to jerk it on an angle.

276
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,801
GILFOYLE: So D2F sub-1 needs
to equal D2F sub-2,

277
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,121
and D2F sub-3 needs to equal D2F sub-4,

278
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:23,240
where length, L, creates
a complementary shaft angle.

291

293

Unless you can hotswap dicks in and out.
So on a downstroke, you get a new one in.

294
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:18,480
So when you stroke up
you're not wasting any energy.

Don't worry about it, Richard.
Ls the platform up and running?

309
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,164
I made a few changes, but yeah...

What were you working on last night?

RICHARD: Well, uh,
I might've made a breakthrough.

is there anything less sexy

318
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:13,480

is completely sub-optimal?

319
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:15,802
I mean, it's the worst, right?

320
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:18,121
So we've gone through all the research
and all the steps.

We have a solution for these problems and Zenella
is ready to bring it to the marketplace.

Yeah, I get it, Richard. You changed a lot.

323
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,969
Now, just give me the basics
and I can roll with it.

324
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,565
I need to know what I'm presenting here.

I thought he made the platform better.

352
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:52,690
- He just deleted everything.
- DINESH: Maybe he moved it to the cloud?

No. All The Carver's work is gone.

00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,764
I mean, what we had before worked.

448
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:05,129
I'm sorry, guys. Gavin won. We lost.

449
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,201
At least it didn't happen in a public
and brutally embarrassing way.

450
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:13,168
- Thanks, Gilfoyle.
- Yeah.

451
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,886
RICHARD: Wait a second. What's happening?

452
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,566
There's no errors, look!

(CROWD MURMURING)

455
00:24:27,040 --> 00:24:29,771
- 5.2? How, how...
- Wait, what?

456
00:24:30,040 --> 00:24:32,247
- Wait, it compressed the whole file?
- Whoa!

457
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,085
That's the whole file.

458
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,771
It's just half the size
I thought it would be.

459
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:40,921
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, obviously we're
going to keep looking at this to verify,</i>

460
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:43,561

the best Weissman score ever measured.</i>

462
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:48,967
<i>- Doubled it!
- (APPLAUSE)</i>

463
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,724
<i>Pied Piper, ladies and gentlemen!</i>

464
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:52,649
<i>Let's hear it for them!</i>

465
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,571
Holy shit!

466
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,242
Hey, I'm at TechCrunch.

467
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:01,324
This kid, Hendricks, and Pied Piper
just ran a two-minute mile.

468
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,890
We should get on this, now.

469
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,482
Suck it, Gavin Belson!

470
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:06,561
(MOUTHING)

471
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,561
Hendricks, you beautiful bastard!

472
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,410
- I told you we'd do it! Come on!
- (LAUGHING)

473
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,323
We're not going to be poor!

474
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:17,205
What happened? What happened?
What happened? What happened?

475
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:18,884
Ah, we just won the cup!

476
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:19,961
(SCREAMS)

477
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,281
Whoo!

478
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:26,729

that the winner of this year's Disrupt Cup</i>

(CHEERING)

481
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,410
So Richard wrote the code?

482
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:40,326
Richard wrote the code, yes,
but the inspiration was clear.

483
00:25:40,760 --> 00:25:41,921
- Let me ask you something.
- Mmm-hmm.

484
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,322
How fast do you think
you could jack off every guy in this room?

485
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:48,121
'Cause I know how long it would take me.

486
00:25:48,800 --> 00:25:49,926
And I can prove it.

487
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:51,570
- Nice.
- Thank you so much.

488
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:54,086
I don't fully understand it
but I would definitely like to invest.

489
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,650
- Oh, great.
- Really impressed.

490
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,085
I really want to get you
in front of my partners.

491
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,964
- Really soon.
- Oh, wow. I appreciate that, guys.

492
00:25:59,040 --> 00:26:01,088
Well, hopefully we'll
talk to each other soon.

493
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:02,241
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

494
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,403
- MONICA: Hey!
- Monica!

495
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:07,563
Congratulations! You were amazing up there.

496
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:09,529
- Thank you.
- I just spoke with Peter.

497
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:13,685
He watched the live-stream via satellite
and said he was "not unpleased."

498
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,604
Oh, yeah, that's great. (CHUCKLES)

499
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:19,482
Uh, so I guess
we're back to working together, huh?

500
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,720
Yeah. Yeah, I guess so.

501
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,848
It's gonna get pretty
insane for you, Richard.

502
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:30,127
- Yeah.
- You're going to have more offers of funding

503
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:31,964
- than you're going to know what to do with.
- Yeah.

504
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,530
You're going to have to grow a business,

505
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,490
- hire a staff, rent offices, get an assistant.
- Mmm-hmm.

506
00:26:36,560 --> 00:26:39,530
Peter is going to be a lot more hands-on
and a lot tougher on you.

507
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,969
People may take credit for your idea
and try and sue you.

508
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,924
- How awesome is that?
- Ah, yeah, that's awesome.

509
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,122
I mean, if you thought it was crazy
getting to this point,

510
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,282
you're not going to believe
what it turns into from here.

511
00:26:50,360 --> 00:26:51,361
Right.

512
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:53,442
I mean pretty soon, you could be
managing thousands of employees

513
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,329
- who are all looking up to you.
- Mmm.

514
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:58,126
And Gavin Belson,
he's not going away anytime soon.

515
00:26:58,200 --> 00:26:59,929
- Mmm.
- But it's going to be amazing.

516
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,725
Excuse me a second.

517
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:13,447
(BURPS)

518
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,124
