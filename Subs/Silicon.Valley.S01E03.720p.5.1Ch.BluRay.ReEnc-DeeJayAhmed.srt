GAVIN: <i>The greatness
of human accomplishment</i>

2
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,368
<i>has always been measured by size.</i>

3
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:14,283
<i>The bigger, the better.</i>

4
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:15,771
<i>Until now.</i>

5
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:17,524
Nanotech.

6
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:19,204
Smart cars.

7
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:20,884
Small is the new big.

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,889
In the coming months,
Hooli will deliver Nucleus,

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,363
the most sophisticated compression software
platform the world has ever seen.

10
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:35,729
Because if we can make
your audio and video files smaller,

11
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:41,364
we can make cancer smaller.
And hunger. And AIDS.

12
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:42,521
DINESH: <i>What</i> an asshole.

13
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,204
Why would he announce it
so far ahead of the actual rollout?

14
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,520
No one does that.

15
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,728
He's got to be doing it
just to fuck with us, right?

16
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,041
I actually think we're okay.
The player I gave them

17
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:54,361
was from a retired
repository that was audio only.

18
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,249
Video compression
is a completely different paradigm.

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,369
What they have is like Pied Piper,
but not as good.

20
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:02,171
- People will see that.
- Not if they get to market before us.

21
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,368
Inferior products win out all the time.

22
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:06,687
Like Jesus over Satan.

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,648
I was going to say VHS over Beta.

24
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,247
Okay, well, actually this is a
superior product, right here.

25
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,970
Is it a margarita machine?

26
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,326
It's better.

27
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,489
My first official purchase
as CEO of Pied Piper.

28
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,922
That's not really our logo is it?

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,241
It looks like a guy sucking a dick

30
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,846
and he's got another
dick tucked behind his ear for later.

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,924
- Like a snack dick. It does.
- No, it's a Pied Piper...

32
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,844
Here, put them on. Gilfoyle, come on.

33
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:35,046
I don't want it.

34
00:01:35,120 --> 00:01:38,727
Jared, I bought these
t-shirts with my credit card

35
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,689
but I think I'm close to
being maxed out, so...

36
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,411
Yeah, we may have a little problem there.

37
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,804
Peter Gregory's check. So?

38
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,167
So, it's made out
to "Pied Piper incorporated,"

39
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:49,924
I checked with the secretary
of state website,

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,288
and there's already
a Pied Piper operating in California.

41
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,449
So we need to change our name.

42
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,444
- Thank God!
- Praise the dark lord, that's great news.

43
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:01,046
No, it's not great news.
We love the name Pied Piper.

44
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,605
It's a classic fairy tale.

45
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:03,846
Well, I looked it up.

46
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,890
It's about a predatory flutist
who murders children in a cave.

47
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,964
It has all of that going for it,
Richard, and I still hate it.

48
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:13,249
Richard, if we are going
to change the name, we need to do it now.

49
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,888
Names stick. My name's only Jared because
Gavin called me that on my first day.

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,411
My real name is Donald.

51
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:22,051
But, Jared, we already bought the T-shirts.

52
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,442
I can't take these back.
It was an online order.

53
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:25,931
What is that atrocity?

54
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:28,088
What are we, an Irish pornography company?

55
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:30,641
I thought we were gonna
replace the name "Pied Piper."

56
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:32,210
I thought it was a place holder.

57
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,489
"Placeholder" would honestly be
a better name than Pied Piper.

58
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,323
Richard, I've actually been holding off
telling people I'm the co-founder

59
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:42,688
of "Pied Piper" because frankly,
it's a little embarrassing.

60
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:48,611
Well, just to remind you,
you are not the co-founder.

61
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,364
So please don't tell anyone.

62
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,168
Richard, take Aviato. That's not a name
I found, it's a name that found me

63
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,765
on a vision quest.

64
00:02:56,920 --> 00:02:58,126
Something that you should do.

65
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,289
No, no. I'm not gonna eat a bunch of drugs
and sit out in the desert,

66
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,522
and hope some name
randomly pops in my head.

67
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,284
Well, then I question your leadership.

68
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,045
Richard, a name defines a company.

69
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:13,286
It has to be something primal, something
that you can scream out during intercourse.

70
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,286
Like Aviato.

71
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:18,044
(MOANING) Uber!

00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,046

Exactly, right.
(MOANING) Pied Piper!

75
00:03:31,960 --> 00:03:37,091
I'm so sorry. Your voice doesn't really reach
that register when you ejaculate, does it?

76
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,084
No, it's just, everyone was doing it,
I was just chiming in.

77
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,364
(SIGHS)

78
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,007
You guys, we can't change our name.

79
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,447
I can't go into Peter Gregory's
office with a new name,

80
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,881
and ask him to cut me a new check.

81
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,321
I mean, he's pulled funding
from companies for a lot less.

82
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,721
The Pied Piper name and trademark

83
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:09,451
are registered to a sprinkler company
in Gilroy.

84
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:11,642
I guess you could head out there
and talk to them.

85
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,049
- But they may refuse...
- Okay. No, no, no. I'll negotiate with them.

86
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,361
No offense, Richard,
but you're not a strong negotiator.

87
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,091
- I'm a great negotiator, Dinesh.
- You're a terrible negotiator.

88
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,083
I'm a decent negotiator.

89
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,770
Just, so...

90
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,127
Oh, Peter, you're here...

91
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:32,363
We were supposed to meet 40 minutes ago
with the guys from Astraphile

92
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,124
about the emergency capital injection.

93
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:38,568
As we discussed,
our North Carolina plant went sideways.

94
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:43,521
So we need 15 million now
or we'll have to shut down.

95
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,645
Have any of you ever eaten at Burger King?

96
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,365
Yes...
(CHUCKLES)

97
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:55,041
Why?

98
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,403
Well, I was just driven past one.

99
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,766
And while I know their market cap
is $7 billion plus,

100
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:06,401
I realize I am unfamiliar
with their offerings.

101
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,891
Okay, fine.

102
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,531
But what does that have to do...

103
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:12,161
Is it popular among your peers?

104
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,722
Is it enjoyed?

105
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,643
- People seem to like it.
- Yeah, it's okay.

106
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:21,327
And their selection
consists solely of these burgers,

107
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:24,722
of which they are presumably king?
(CHUCKLES)

108
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,164
They have other things. Chicken, fish.

109
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:30,083
I'm sorry. What are we doing here?

110
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:31,161
(LAUGHS NERVOUSLY)

111
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,005
Here is what we will do.

112
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:38,325
Monica, have one of the assistants
go to the nearest Burger King location

113
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,802
and purchase one of everything.

114
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,602
JARED: Hey, Dinesh. Dinesh.

115
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:52,446
I'm on the phone with the bank and they say
they need an extra form for your payroll,

116
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,931
because of your visa?

117
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,371
Visa? What visa?

118
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,601
I'm a fucking US citizen.

119
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:59,610
I have Dinesh Chugtai here,
and he's pretty irate because...

120
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,970
Oh, I see...

121
00:06:03,880 --> 00:06:05,928
Bertram Gilfoyle is the foreign national.

122
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,565
Citizen of Canada.

123
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,920
Okay, thank you.

124
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,131
You're Canadian?

125
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,290
Your borders are merely a construct.

126
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:17,125
I prefer to think of myself
as a citizen of the world.

127
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,443
Do you mind just sending them
the form so they know you're here legally?

128
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:21,726
Yes, I mind.

129
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,691
And also I may not be.

130
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:26,681
To wit, maybe you could
make out my checks to cash?

131
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,560
Or bitcoin.

132
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,563
I didn't know I was
working with an illegal.

133
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,286
The irony.

134
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:36,047
Well, sometimes we do center pivot,

135
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:38,771
but mainly we do lineal
like you see out there.

136
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,806
What is it your business does again?

137
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,566
Something to do with algebra?

138
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:47,171
Algorithm, actually.

139
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,651
It's for compression.

140
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,891
Ultimately what we're trying to do is...

141
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:55,163
(CHUCKLES)
You remind me of my son.

142
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,688
He's got Asperger's, too.

143
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:59,000
Oh, no, I don't...

144
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:02,126
Probably all those pesticides
they put on the crops.

145
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,049
Well, whatever it is your business does,

146
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:08,488
I don't think it's going to interfere
with my irrigation company here.

147
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,007
I'm thinking about getting in
another line of work anyway.

148
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:14,521
All these foreigners coming over here,

149
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:19,083
putting pieces of shit like that
all over the good farmland around here.

150
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,006
All so people can sit around,
stare at their phones all day.

151
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,042
Nobody jerks off to magazines anymore.

152
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:36,170
Well, actually, that is a server farm.

153
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,845
What we do, compression,

154
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:41,163
would mean fewer of those,
because we'd save a lot of memory space.

155
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,131
- Really?
- Yeah.

156
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,441
Well, I'm all for that, believe me.

157
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:47,571
I'll tell you what.

You can have the name for $1,000.

How's that sound?

That sounds great! Yeah, cool.

Just like my boy.

00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,321
Yeah.

Go for Erlich.

166
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:19,450
This is Richard Hendricks,
CEO of Pied Piper.

167
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:22,769
That's right. You guys said
I was a bad negotiator, but I closed it!

168
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,888
We got a name. Tell everyone you know.

169
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:26,924
Oh, all right.

170
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,045
You don't sound that impressed.

171
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:30,361
ERLICH: No, no, lam.

172
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,646
I just...

173
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:35,924
Now we're Pied Piper. So, later.

174
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,046
Here you go.

175
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:42,770
You must drink a lot of margaritas?

176
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,081
We will now.
I have a startup that just got funded

177
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,686
so this is just kind of
a gift for my guys to celebrate.

178
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,366
Good luck with that.

179
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:53,125
You'll need it, too,
when this town kicks you in the balls.

180
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,765
- Okay. Sure.
- Let me get the door for you.

181
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:56,683
I had three startups, myself,

182
00:08:56,760 --> 00:09:00,367
and I couldn't get those
Sand Hill Road morons to fund any of them.

183
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:03,410
Cowards. My last company was genius.

184
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,761
Have you ever been
lost in a parking lot before?

185
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,208
See, what my app would do is
use existing AVL technology, right?

186
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:13,604
So you would just type in the VIN number. And
if your car didn't have AVL capabilities

187
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,684
you would just type in whatever section
of the parking lot you were in,

188
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:19,411
like P3, or ground seven.

189
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,324
So you just, you just write down what
section of the parking lot you're in?

190
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,686
Why do you need an app for that?

191
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,410
So you can remember where you parked.

192
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:28,563
Right, but why don't you
just write it down on a piece of paper?

193
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,722
Well, yeah. But this is for your phone.

194
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,650
Okay, so it's just sorta like Notepad?

195
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,770
- Exactly! See? You get it.
- Yeah. I get it.

196
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,002
- Why can't all those fucking VCs?
- I don't know.

197
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,161
- (CHUCKLES)
- Pussies, man.

198
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:41,480
Oh, there we go, thanks.

00:09:54,040 --> 00:09:55,769
This is which one?

201
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,365
The BK Double Stacker.

202
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,005
Fascinating...

203
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:05,010
Peter, I know that you are
incredibly busy with... This.

204
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:08,729
But I made a personal promise
to the Astraphile guys

205
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,566
that none of their employees would lose their
job, which will happen at midnight to...

206
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:14,642
Do you see this?

00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,281
The Junior Whopper?

208
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:19,204
No, not the sandwich.

209
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,802
This seed atop the breading.

210
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,211
Those are sesame seeds.

211
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,405
A high number of these breadings
have sesame seeds on them.

212
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,003
Billions of breadings.

213
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,570
Sesame seeds.

214
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,371
They only grow in certain microclimates.

215
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,647
Peter, I know you don't want to cause

- Who?
- Herb Cohen.

221
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:11,605
He's a famous negotiator.
Wrote a bunch of textbooks.

222
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,445
- No?
- What?

223
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,842
- Have you seen the blogs?
- RICHARD: No.

224
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,809
Erlich went HAM on all the tech sites.

225
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,690
He had TechCrunch, Recode, and PandoDaily.

You read Recode?

239
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,724
I do when my customers tell me

I do, actually.

it took me to become a citizen?

We don't. And when Keith finds that out,

it's gonna be a valuable
business lesson for him.

Who's "we"?

00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,090
This morning you rudely reminded me

290
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,650
that I wasn't a founder
of this company and now

291
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,324
you want me to hold your hand
and help you out?

292
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:05,765
I don't think so, sister.

So now the CEO of Pied Piper
can't even afford to buy lunch.

298
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,611
Yeah, I don't think
we can use that name anymore.

00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:01,290
I was this close to giving up,
and now you gave me my dream back, man!

314
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,488
- But“
- Oh, hey, Ron!

315
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:07,162
You see this guy? This billionaire here?

316
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:10,562
He's the reason why I'm quitting!
(CHUCKLES)

317
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:14,765
- Jamie, no...
- Well, you've helped me so much,

318
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:16,922
what can I do for you?

319
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,601
(GULPS)

320
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:23,049
Well, I need to return this machine because
I'm broke, and I need money for food.

321
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:32,407
Just a quick question.

322
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:37,725
Is this gonna be a cash return,
or does it credit back to the card?

323
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:45,649
All right, what about "Smaller,"
spelled "S-M-L-L-R"?

324
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,722
You know, because we make things smaller,

325
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:51,367
and this would be like
a smaller version of the word "smaller."

326
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,522
- It looks like "smeller."
- Okay.

327
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,245
What if we spell it...

328
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,411
"S-M-L-R?"

329
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,442
Because that's an even smaller
version of the word "smaller."

330
00:16:04,520 --> 00:16:05,851
Then it looks like Smiler.

331
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,402
We're not gonna kick the shit
out of Nucleus with Smiler.

332
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,523
Where's Richard?
Why isn't he in here for this?

333
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:14,331
I think he was out back,
wishing he'd taken the $10 million.

334
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:18,564
No, I just saw him in his room,
wishing he had taken the $10 million.

335
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:25,041
You know Smiler is also something
that guys call women's assholes.

336
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,487
(DOOR OPENS)

337
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,007
Richard, why aren't you in there,
coming up with new names?

338
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:33,289
I don't want a new name. I want Pied Piper.

339
00:16:33,560 --> 00:16:35,847
But, apparently, I can't have that.

340
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,922
So now I have to come up with a new name

341
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,446
and take that to Peter Gregory
and ask for a new check.

342
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,962
He's gonna pull our funding,
Gavin Belson's going to crush us,

343
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:47,169
and we will be ruined
because I have no idea what I'm doing.

344
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:51,006
Neither did Zuckerberg
when he was running Facebook at 19.

345
00:16:51,080 --> 00:16:55,244
You think he had any real-world
business experience? No. None.

346
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:59,365
But he was such a tough negotiator
that now all of his friends are suing him.

347
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:02,171
How awesome is that? And Steve Jobs?

348
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,242
He took a shit-ton of hallucinogens.

349
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,445
What a coincidence.
Maybe something that you could actually do.

350
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:10,122
I'm not going on some fucking vision quest.

351
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,160
Okay, let me get this straight,
you would rather do nothing than something?

352
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:15,722
Because all the guys in the other room

353
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:19,009
coming up with shitty names like,
Smallulator, are at least doing something.

(SIGHS)

355
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,406
Fine. I'll just do it myself.

356
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:26,321
I'll be back in 24 to 72 hours.

357
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,364
Have a cold pitcher of water
and some orange slices ready for me.

358
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,889
You know what,
I'm really gonna go for this motherfucker

359
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,122
so you better have some
grapefruit ready, too.

360
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:39,488
I'm gonna come back with a name so amazing
that Peter Gregory will write us 10 checks.

361
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,570
What about, Dwarfism 2.0?

362
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,325
Where's Dwarfism 1.0?

363

Just in the world.

Oh.

365
00:17:47,680 --> 00:17:48,806
That's prejudice.

00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:50,763
- That's hurtful.
- I'm sorry.

Hello, Mr. Garris.

375
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:31,529
Yes, this is Richard from the company
that is rightly called Pied Piper.

376
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:33,560
That's right.

377
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:38,567
No, no, no. You listen to me.
Okay. We had a handshake deal.

378
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:43,089
And that may not mean a lot to you,
but where I'm from, that means a whole lot.

379
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:45,640
Okay, you agreed to sell me
that name for $1,000.

380
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:50,362
So let me ask you this? Are you an honest
man or are you a goddamn liar?

381
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,567
Okay. Yes, same address?

382
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,810
Good, yeah, great. See you then.

383
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:02,805
Dude, that was fucking badass.
What did he say?

384
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,121
He said he was gonna get in his truck,

385
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,362
drive down here
and beat the living shit out of me.

386
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:08,965
Why did you say that was your address?

387
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:10,690
- Say any other address.
- I don't know.

388
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:12,888
He's got a very powerful voice.

What are we gonna do?

390
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,644
If you keep screaming your name,

391
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:19,087
it forces the assailant
to acknowledge you as a human.

392
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:51,091
It is now 5:35 PM
and I have ingested the psilocybin.

- Should I call 911?
- No, that's a pussy move.

Okay. $1,000.

Making the world a better place.
Making the world a better place.

467
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,169
- Making the world a better place.
- Sir?

468
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:43,490
Are you okay in there?

469
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:45,767
- Making the world a better place.
- He's been in there all night.

470
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,649
I should call the sheriff.

471
00:23:47,920 --> 00:23:49,729
Making the world a better place.

472
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:52,647
No, I... Hey, I told you
he's going to handle it!

473
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,848
- Mr. Gregory, this is ridiculous.
- Sir...

474
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,163
Mr. Gregory, we need an answer
and we need it now!

475
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:03,130
- Yes?
- We need money. Now.

476
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,328
And I'm sure that Burger King
and sesame seeds

477
00:24:05,400 --> 00:24:07,528
and whatever else you've been
mumbling about in here

478
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,284
all seem lovely to think about...

479
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,488
Myanmar and Brazil.

480
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,130
No, no! No more of this!

481
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,806
Okay, are we getting the money or not?

482
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:18,884
Will you please tell us
what the hell is going on?

483
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:24,003
Amusing coincidence
that two of the three countries

484
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:29,211
that provide the world's sesame seeds
have such large cicada populations, no?

485
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:32,769
The cicadas of Myanmar
emerge every 13 years,

486
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:36,401
while the Brazilian
cicadas emerge every 17.

487
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,566
Next year they will hatch, simultaneously,

488
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,122
for the first time in 221 years.

489
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:48,126
Crops from both countries
will be decimated.

490
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,249
Unlike Myanmar and Brazil,
Indonesia has no cicada population.

491
00:24:54,320 --> 00:25:00,123
I was surprised to see Indonesian
sesame seed futures priced so low.

492
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:02,530
I made a purchase.

493
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,002
And now, if the shortage
spikes the global price

494
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:09,448
even 10% we'll profit...

495
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,761
- Evan?
- $68 million.

496
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,089
If you wish, I could tap
that projected revenue and make you

497
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:18,965
a bridge loan of $15 million, gentlemen.

498
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,766
- (BOTH EXHALE)
- Unless you need more?

499
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,207
No, that's... Thank you.
Thank you, holy shit.

500
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,123
Yes? Happy?

501
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:29,011
See? I told you he was taking care of it.

502
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:33,450
And now, would anyone like some BK?

503
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:36,965
(CHUCKLES) Evan was kind enough
to go out and get breakfast.

504
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:38,565
It's just sitting here.

505
00:25:38,680 --> 00:25:42,366
- Actually, we'd... I'd love some.
- Thank you so much.

506
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,122
Is there cumin in this barbecue sauce?

507
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:53,611
- I will definitely find out.
- Please do.

508
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,841
Gentlemen, we just got back from the bank.

509
00:26:03,920 --> 00:26:05,968
Our first deposit slip.

510
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,168
We are officially Pied Piper.

511
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:09,884
And I am officially legal.

512
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:12,964
Dinesh wouldn't shut the hell up,
so we finally went to the visa office.

513
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:14,486
Took me five minutes.

514
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:18,884
Took me five years. They asked me
about Al-Qaeda, like, 14 times.

515
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,765
He literally got it while
I was still looking for parking.

516
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,841
(CELLPHONE RINGS)

517
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,726
<i>- Hello.
- WOMAN: Is this Pied Piper?</i>

518
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,566
It is now, but we're not taking
any follow-on investors at this point.

519
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:35,487
<i>Investors? No, this is Kelsey
from the Arco station out on 108.</i>

520
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:39,929
<i>Someone smeared your name
and number in shit on my bathroom wall.</i>

521
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:43,925
- I think you may have the wrong number...
- Richie.

522
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:46,206
Oh, hey, guys.

523
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:49,764
Hi. Who is this?

524
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:52,525
You're not gonna believe
this, but this is me.

525
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:57,128
Time is a sphere and I've been reincarnated
during the same time period in which I exist.

526
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,725
Yes, but where did he come from?

527
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,201
From the future, obviously.

528
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:04,329
Also, from a parking lot
at a gas station in Sonora.

529
00:27:05,240 --> 00:27:07,368
He ate the whole bag of gold caps.

530
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,001
Awesome!

531
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,525
Erlich...
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

532
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:22,244
So, should I call the cops now
before anyone else does?

533
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:26,086
I just got an Amber Alert
for Rogilio Núñez.

534
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:27,681
Yeah, okay.
