You said he had paintings in galleries.

5

His works hang in the
gallery of the streets.

- Pleasure to meet you.

This is great. Look at this.

This is what we need, you know what I mean?
Something raw.

25

We already have kind of a shitty name,
Pied Piper,

is two lowercase P's in a square

across the freeway would make.

- Yeah. You know Dave Choe?

He did all the murals over at Facebook.

32

He got a stock option deal,
ended up making, like, $100 million.

Well, you told me you own 10% of it.

38

So you must know something about it, right?

39
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,129
You could just give me some of your points.

Yeah. Yeah, he's Latino.

Yeah. And he's one of
the best coders we have.

He kind of adds a Latin
flair to the company.

I think we should get out of here, though,

JARED: Okay, let's start the meeting.

204
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:02,008
I think we need to define
our corporate culture.

205
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:06,450
Our whole corporate culture
is that we don't have a corporate culture.

206
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,363
That is totally ridiculous, Gilfoyle.

207
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:11,171
The main reason dogs are perceived
to have a more keen sense of smell

208
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:12,844
is because their noses
are closer to the ground.

209
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:17,050
Therefore, with a little practice, I could
easily have as keen a sense of smell as a dog's.

Guys? I guess you didn't see the sign.

We're actually having a meeting here.

212
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:22,926
Congratulations.

213
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,122
It's sort of for management only.

Are you fucking serious right now?
Are you really kicking us out?

215
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,044
Well, I thought, maybe you guys could just
take your food into the living room.

216
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:37,640
So you want to have a meeting
in the room where all the food is,

217
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,921

Guys, just five minutes. Please?

219
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,646
Okay, you see? This is a case in point.

220
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,566
This is a company, and yet we have
no boundaries and no protocol.

221
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,486
We need to establish a clear corporate
culture or we're not gonna make it.

222
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,483
Take Dinesh and Gilfoyle.

223
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,484
They are wasting
an enormous amount of time arguing.

224
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,161
What if we were to separate them, right?

225
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,124
Divide their existing work space
into two areas.

226
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,089
We could put in
some kind of portable barrier...

228

GILFOYLE: We are not doing cubicles.
No way!

229
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,760
No, no, no, no. Don't
think of it as a cubicle.

230
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,804
Just think of it as a, uh,
neutral-colored enclosure,

231
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,281
about yay high, around your workspace.

232
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,124
Okay, fine.
But do you know who uses cubicles?

233
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,009
Every single Fortune 500 company.

234
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,411
Why? Because they work.

Actually, you know, I think
a better analogy would be jazz.

238
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:44,247
Like we riff and improvise
around a central theme

239

to create one cohesive piece of music.

240

No, no. They teach fucking
jazz at Juilliard.

241

We're not jazz. We're fucking punk rock.

to use to agree with each other.

00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:23,648
This is displeasing.

313
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:27,247
I have never seen him so incensed.

314
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,084
What the hell were you thinking, Richard?

315
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:32,130
How could you not tell us
that you entered TechCrunch Disrupt?

316
00:14:32,200 --> 00:14:34,123
I applied before I even met you guys.

317
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:36,362
I wasn't gonna say anything
because I was gonna withdraw.

318
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,125
- No, you're not.
- I'm not? Why not?

319
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:43,444
Because of you, Gavin Belson
is debuting Nucleus at TCD.

320
00:14:43,520 --> 00:14:46,649
If you pull out, it looks like
Peter is running away from Gavin.

321
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:51,442
So like it or not, you are presenting a live
demo in front of the world in eight weeks.

322
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:53,170
A live demo of what?

323
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,131
I entered TCD with an early build of Pied
Piper when it was still just a music app.

324
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:59,965
No. Sorry. Executive decision.
We are not doing TechCrunch.

325
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:03,442
Okay. So let me just
tell you what's gonna happen.

326
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,286
Peter will pull all of his support
and pass on any further funding,

327
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,091
which, as you know, is the most
flaming signaling risk on Earth.

328
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:15,121
You'll burn through the rest of your runway,
no one will step in, then you'll go bust.

329
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,770
(SIGHING) I don't get it.

330
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:19,161
Doesn't Peter Gregory
want what's best for the company?

331
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,365
(SIGHING)

332
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,211
Look. I'm going to be straight with you.

333
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,448
Peter Gregory doesn't care.

334
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,285
- About?
- You.

335
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,561
Wait. Just him or both of us?

336
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:39,120
Any of you. Pied Piper.

337
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,771
Okay... (CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)

338
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,286
Uh, well, then why did he back us?

339
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:47,967
Does he just want to piss off Gavin Belson?
He spent $200,000 just...

340
00:15:48,040 --> 00:15:50,088
Yeah, that's nothing.

341
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,960
Peter would spend millions
just to mildly annoy Gavin.

342
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:55,530
These are billionaires, Richard.

343
00:15:55,640 --> 00:15:59,042
Humiliating each other is worth more
to them than we'll make in a lifetime.

344
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,806
(CHUCKLING) I see.

345
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:04,884
And you conveniently
forgot to mention any of this

346
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:08,567
when you were convincing me
to turn down $10 million?

347
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:12,087
And now I'm in the middle of some
pissing contest between two billionaires.

348
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:14,170
In fairness,

349
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,961
Gavin only offered you the $10 million
because we started pursuing you...

350
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:20,560
Yeah, but he offered it to me, Monica!
He offered it to me.

351
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:22,529
$10 dollars and I didn't take it.

352
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,570
Because you came to me
when I was puking and freaking out

353
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:28,484
and told me that
Peter Gregory believed in me,

354
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,642
when in reality,
he didn't even give a flying fuck!

355
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:32,046
- Richard...
- Oh, my God.

356
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,011
I didn't turn down $10 million
because of Peter Gregory, Monica!

357
00:16:36,080 --> 00:16:38,082
I turned it down because of you!

358
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,164
However angry he is, I
am one-tenth as angry.

359
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,084
Because one of the $10 million
would've been mine.

360
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:53,731
- Because I own 10%.
- I know.

361
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,450
- Of Pied Piper.
- I know!

362
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,685
- (DOOR RATTLING)
- It's push.

363
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:10,081
(SIGHING)

364
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:13,560
We didn't think we were going to get this
thing done when we had five months to do it.

365
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:14,601
Now we have two?

366
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,324
Granted, it's not ideal,
but we're just gonna have to...

367
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,686
What the good fuck?

368
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,445
RICHARD: What is happening?
Is that Dinesh?

369
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:23,523
ERLICH: Is that the Statue of Liberty?

370
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,489
And it's...

371
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,130
There's penetration.

372
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,683
Oh! Hey, neighbor.

373
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:32,521
- Ashley's getting big!
- Aw.

374
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:34,329
She looks...

375
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:36,482
- What do we do?
- I don't know. Paint over it.

376
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:39,440
No, no, no. You can't paint over it.
It's, like, the code of the streets.

377
00:17:39,480 --> 00:17:41,164
- People get shot behind that.
- Oh, good.

378
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,890
Hey. So what do guys think, man?

379
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,246
Uh...

380
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,243
I think Erlich had a few thoughts.

381
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,766
So, I gotta...

382
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:50,641
I'll let you...

383
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,605
(SIGHING) Uh...

384
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:58,924
Here's the headline.

385
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:02,129
There's a lot right with it.
A lot of good stuff in there.

386
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,765
But I just...
Do you think the piece is working?

387
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:10,926
I mean, maybe it's
a bit too graphic for the space?

388
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:12,365
No way. Look at it.

389
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:15,125
It comments on the whole Latino struggle
for justice in America.

390
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:18,921
But even without all the symbolism,
it's just aesthetically pleasing.

391
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,001
Yeah.

392
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:24,406
All right, here's the real shit, Chuy.

393
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,289
Uh, you know, our prize coder,

394
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:29,842
he's actually not Latino.

395
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,401
What?

396
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:33,323
Yeah. Point of fact is, he's Pakistani.

397
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,606
Homes, you lied to me.

398
00:18:34,680 --> 00:18:37,081
No, no, no. You thought he was Latino,

399
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,289
and I thought that I would be racist
telling you you were wrong.

400
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:42,601
Come on, man. Why would you think that?

401
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,762
Thinking that, now that's racist.

402
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:48,481
God, I can't Win with that.

403
00:18:48,560 --> 00:18:53,282
Look, Chuy, painting a guy
named Dinesh Chugtai as an Aztec warrior

404
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,970
just doesn't make sense.

405
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:58,441
Yeah. You know what?

406
00:18:58,520 --> 00:18:59,646
I think you might be right, boss.

407
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,200
Great. That's... Um...

408
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,328
So... Perfect. So change that

409
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,644
and then don't have him be fucking
the literal symbol of freedom.

410
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,961
And then, whatever else you wanna do.

411
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,088
- All right.
- All right.

412
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:18,166
If I had known, we could have withdrawn your
application before any of this happened.

413
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,891
This is exactly why we need to have
clearer lines of communication.

414
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,485
I know, Jared, I know.

415
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:27,441
Listen, I'd like to institute
an organizational system called Scrum.

416
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:28,766
Scrum is designed to...

417
00:19:28,840 --> 00:19:30,649
DINESH: All right, you have one hour! Go!

418
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:32,922
(SNIFFING) No.

419
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,206
No. Just musty.

420
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,645
Uh, what's going on?

421
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:37,165
Gilfoyle bet me 100 bucks

422
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,124
that if I touched one object in this room,
he could find it just by sniffing.

423
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:42,004
Okay. Not now, please.

424
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,368
No, it has to be now.
I just masturbated to heighten my focus.

425
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,010
I have a 15-minute refractory period.

426
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,885
- Ow.
- Uh, well, we have a lot of work to get done.

427
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,365
So maybe we should do that instead, please?

428
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,521
Dude, relax, okay?

429
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,364
We each ripped through
a full module this morning.

430
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,761
We're just taking a little break.

431
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,081
DRM is now a thing of beauty.
(CLICKING TONGUE)

432
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,130
- Wait. You did DRM?
- Yeah.

433
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,326
I did DRM.

434
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,811
Why did you do DRM?

435
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,882
I said I would do DRM,
you would do error handling.

436
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,123
Anything to do with "error"
sounds like your whole vibe.

437
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,201
DINESH: Yeah, I handle
errors like you every day.

438
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:11,281
Scrum?

439
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,966
- Yes, Scrum.
- Scrum. (CHUCKLES)

440
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,848
JARED: So from "rules based filtering,"
we go to "workflow,"

441
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:20,730
at which point that card
is moved from the "icebox"

442
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:25,283
into the "in progress" column and it stays
there until it is ready for "testing."

443
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,603
Okay. This increases visibility
into our team's progress.

444
00:20:28,680 --> 00:20:31,331
And that, gentlemen, is Scrum.

445
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:34,328
Welcome to the next eight
weeks of our lives.

446
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,289
This just became a job.

447
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,007
Okay, so here are the cards

448
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,811
I'm adding under this epic
for the ingestion engine.

449
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,530
And there are three stories here.

450
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,884
How long do we think each one will take?

451
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,122
I don't know. Who cares?

452
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,486
Four hours apiece?

453
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:52,284
Yeah. Maybe for you.

454
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:54,840
Each one of those tasks
would take me three max.

455
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,604
Not "tasks," "stories."

456
00:20:56,680 --> 00:20:58,842
I've got a story.
Why don't you choke on my balls?

457
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:00,490
Well, how about this?

458
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:02,767
Why don't you each take one story, right?

459
00:21:04,040 --> 00:21:05,201
Okay.

460
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,487
And we'll see who's right.

461
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,289
You see what he's doing, right?

462
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,443
He's trying to get us to compete
so we work faster.

463
00:21:12,520 --> 00:21:17,765
He thinks this wall of Psych 101,
MBA, mind control bullshit

464
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:19,211
is going to motivate us.

465
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,204
Fine. Don't compete.
