17
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,481
Like how I would imagine cum tastes.

Holy shit, this one is looking for

64
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:23,724
a "relationship that has the potential
to become sexual in nature."

Boy, is she on the spectrum.

00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,286
She can't even make eye contact

Richard, can I talk to you for a second?

68
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,645
- Solo.
- Mmm-hmm.

69
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,888
We need to talk about Pied Piper.

70
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,726
What about it? The
website's up and running,

71
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,280
I'm just redesigning the compression.
It just needs users.

72
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,169
Yeah, no shit.

73
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,924
But even if somebody wanted to use it,

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,731
they wouldn't be able to figure out how to.
It's incomprehensible.

75
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:52,482
Now, Richard,
when you pitched me Pied Piper

76
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,483
you said it was gonna be,
"The Google of Music."

77
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,449
Which is a really rad
way to pitch something.

78
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:58,887
I mean, I liked it.
I thought it had applications.

79
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,928
No, it has all that.
Look, when it blows up,

80
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,571
and it will once it reaches
a critical mass of users,

81
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:06,445
Pied Piper will be able to search
the whole world of recorded music

82
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:10,320
to find out if there's a match to see if
you're infringing on any copyrighted material.

83
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:11,961
So, if you're a songwriter or a band...

84
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:15,322
Okay, first of all, nobody gives a shit
about stealing other people's music, okay?

85
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:18,683
Everybody involved in the music industry
is either stealing it or sharing it.

86
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:20,967
They're all a bunch of assholes,
especially Radiohead.

- No.

00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,209
Yeah, they're assholes.

00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,567

you want to live here,

90
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,085
- you've got to deliver.
- Mmm.

91
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:31,610
I can't have dead weight
at my incubator, okay?

92
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,843
Either that, or show some promise,
for fuck's sake.

93
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,042
Like NipAlert, Big Head's app.

94
00:04:37,200 --> 00:04:40,204
It gives you the location
of a woman with erect nipples.

95
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,691
Now, that's something people want.

96
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,962
Richard, you need to get
in touch with humanity.

97
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,885
When I sold my company, Aviato,

98
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,486
I wanted to give back.

99
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:51,645
That's why I started this place,
to do something big. To make a difference.

103
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,681
Uh, Steve Jobs or Steve...

104
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,171
Oh, I heard you.

105
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,043
- Which one?
- Jobs.

106
00:05:04,920 --> 00:05:08,447
I mean, Jobs was a poser.
He didn't even write code.

107
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,729
You just disappeared up your own asshole.

108
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,247
- You know that? You did.
- Well, technically...

109
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,285
Big Head, I'm gonna be meditating.

110
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,081
He knew how to package the ideas,
but it was Wozniak that...

111
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,571
<i>What is Hooli? Excellent question.</i>

112

$4500 a month, with five people.

Pied Piper is a proprietary site
that lets you find out

00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,804
if your music is infringing
on any existing copyrights.

Yeah, no, just imagine if you were.

"Pied Piper is a proprietary site."

Well, I just did but it wasn't easy.

Crunching all those songs to find matches

222

- What the fuck am I waiting for?
- Uh, see ya.

319
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,125
Well, it's like Gavin always says,
"it takes change to make change."

320
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,530
Uh, yeah, I think I've
seen that written around.

321
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,601
- Hey.
- Hi.

322
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,442
Gavin is running 30 minutes late

323
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:40,002
but you should know,
he is very excited to see you, Richard.

324
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:41,081
Oh.

325
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:42,650
EXECUTIVE: He's with his spiritual advisor.

326
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,960
He shouldn't be that much longer.

327
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:47,601
I'm a VP here and I only get to see him
about 10 minutes a month.

328
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,763
Yeah, but that 10 minutes
is just incredible.

329
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,526
I heard Richard Hendricks was here.

330
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,809
Have you ever met Gavin before?

331
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,325
- No.
- No?

332
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:01,046
Oh, I told him, it's amazing.

333
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,840
That hardly begins to describe it.

334
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:06,601
(LAUGHS)

335
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,681
- it's weird.
- (SOOTHING MUSIC PLAYING)

336
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,687
They always travel in groups of five.

337
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:15,446
These programmers, there's
always a tall skinny white guy,

338
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,443
short skinny Asian guy,

339
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,045
fat guy with a ponytail,

340
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:21,009
some guy with crazy facial hair

341
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,765
and then an East Indian guy.

342
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,251
It's like they trade guys
until they all have the right group.

343
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,920
You clearly have a great
understanding of humanity.

344
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,285
And Gavin said, "I'm not humiliating you,
I'm elevating you."

345
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,930
Oh, Gavin...

346
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,321
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

347
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:49,844
This is Richard.

348
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:52,086
It's Peter Gregory.

349
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,081
Uh...

350
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,401
No.

351
00:16:58,040 --> 00:16:59,087
Come on, Big Head.

352
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,685
Yeah, I'm coming. Slow...

353
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,211
Why are you going that fast?

354
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,320
'Cause we've got a meeting
with Gavin Belson.

355
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:05,361
Pick up the pace.

356
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:06,640
- We honestly don't.
- Come on.

357
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:17,567
I'm actually outside of Gavin Belson's
office right now, Mr. Gregory.

358
00:17:17,800 --> 00:17:21,202
Uh, here he comes, so can I call you back
in a second?

359
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:23,851
So, Richard Hendricks is here!

360
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,601
(WHISPERING)

361
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:28,091
- There you are, Richard.
- Hi.

362
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:31,560
So sorry these gentleman
have kept you waiting.

363
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:33,080
- That's fine.
- So here's the thing.

364
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:35,248
I love what you did.

365
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,440
- Really?
- Fill him in, Jared.

366
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,321
Now, as you know, Hooli is seen as possibly
the most progressive company in the world.

367
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:45,007
Part of that is Gavin's
commitment to social justice,

368
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:49,611
but part of it is his personal commitment
to the people that work at Hooli.

369
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:53,082
In that spirit Gavin is prepared to
give you a very substantial raise,

370
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,525
and a promotion to go with it.

371
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:56,569
I own 10 percent.

372
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,768
He created it while living in my incubator.

373
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,691
Erlich Bachman. This is Big Head.

374
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,326
I don't know what any of that means,

375
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:06,244
but I'll give you 600
thousand dollars for it.

376
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:09,324
We have the reach and the resources
to take what you have done

377
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:11,966
and push it to the global level.

378
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:15,089
- That is a generous offer. I, um...
- (CELL PHONE RINGING)

379
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,801
Shit, sorry. Hello. (CLEARS THROAT)

380
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:20,604
Really? No shit, that's...

381
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:24,927
Uh, yeah, yeah. No, here.
It's Peter Gregory.

382
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:27,050
Not sure how he got my number.

383
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:28,921
Uh, this is Richard.

384
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,082
I'll give you $3 million for it
right now!

385
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,521
Uh...

386
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,888
Gavin Belson just offered me
$3 million for Pied Piper.

387
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:40,289
I'm prepared to give you $300,000.

388
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:44,202
Peter Gregory just offered me 300...

389
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,723
Did you say thousand dollars?

390
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,365
For 10% of your company.

391
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:49,841
Okay, 4 million.

392
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:52,770
200,000.

393
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,045
- For 5%.
- Huh?

394
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,563
You just went down.

395
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,327
No, you're still valued
at four million dollars.

396
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:05,724
But you own 95%
of a potential billion-dollar company.

397
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,402
<i>And not just that,
I will help you build this company.</i>

398
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:12,001
I will introduce you
to the people you need to know

399
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:14,401
and provide the counsel that you need.

400
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:17,928
I will take a small piece,
but the company will belong to you.

401
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,481
<i>Not Gavin Belson.</i>

402
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,408
<i>You have until tomorrow to decide.</i>

403
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:25,761
Uh...

404
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,080
Okay.

405
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,361
- Um, you know...
- Pull your head out of your ass, Richard.

406
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:33,889
I'm offering you
$4 million right now.

407
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,007
Mmm...

408
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:36,761
I'm...

409
00:19:38,080 --> 00:19:39,605
That is a lot of money.

410
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:45,050
You know, I actually have to...

411
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:47,208
I've got to go to the bathroom.

412
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,281
I've got to pee.

413
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,727
It's desperate. I'm bursting.

414
00:19:51,160 --> 00:19:53,049
I'll be right back, but right now...

415
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,281
Okay, 10 million.

416
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,681
No. Maybe.

417
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,200
I didn't mean to snap at you.

418
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,123
I'll talk in a bit.

419
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,690
Won't be long.

420
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:10,006
Little more about me.

421
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:14,210
I am the founder of Aviato, and I own
a very small percentage of Grindr.

422
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,965
It's a men to men dating site

423
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,168
where you can find other men
within 10 miles of you

424
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,965
interested in having sexual intercourse
in a public restroom.

425
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,245
In the homosexual community
there's sometimes anonymous...

426
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,560
I know what Grindr is.

427
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:27,971
I have gay friends.

428
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:40,684
So you will survive.

429
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,280
It's just a garden variety panic attack.

430
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,930
Welcome to Silicon Valley.

431
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,809
We see people like you all the time.

432
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,531
- Really?
- Yes.

433
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,921
It's just I have to make
this decision by tomorrow.

434
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,490
Yeah. You know, a while back,

435
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:54,767
we had a guy in here
in almost the exact same situation,

436
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:56,320
"Take the money or keep the company."

437
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,681
What happened?

438
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:01,445
Well, a couple months later,

439
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:04,808
he was brought into the ER
with a self-inflicted gunshot wound.

440
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,848
I guess he really regretted
not taking that money.

441
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:09,961
He shot himself because
he turned down the money?

442
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,605
Yeah.

443
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:13,689
Or no, he took the money.

444
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,326
Or no.

445
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:17,325
No, he did not. I don't... You know what?

446
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:19,050
I don't remember. But whatever it was,

447
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,963
he regretted it so much
that he ended up shooting himself.

448
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:23,088
- And now he's blind.
- He's blind?

449
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,003
Yeah, just FYI,
if you're ever gonna shoot yourself,

450
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:26,491
don't hold the gun up to your temple, okay?

451
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:29,291
Because that just basically took out
both of his optic nerves and then,

452
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:30,850
you know, half of his face.

453
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,968
And then his wife left him,
because, you know...

454
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:35,125
- Yikes.
- Right.

455
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,250
He may have been a genius programmer

456
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:39,891
but not so much
in human anatomy. (LAUGHS)

457
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,564
Or decision making, for that matter.

458
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,561
Now he's got to live with all that

459
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:46,490
and whatever terrible decision
he made about the money.

460
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:51,402
Uh, and what do I do if I feel
another panic attack coming on?

461
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,923
Mmm. Would you be interested in a device

462
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:58,522
that links up to your smartphone
and it keeps track of your vitals

463
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:00,284
and it tells you, even
before it's happening,

464
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:03,011
whether you're having a panic attack
or an actual heart attack?

465
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:05,285
Yeah, that sounds great.

466
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,569
You would, right? Okay, that's great news.

467
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:10,762
Because it's still in prototype phase
right now,

468
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:12,683
but my start-up partners
and I are looking for investors.

469
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,888
Like today. So will you
please let me know...

470
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:15,961
I'm going to give you my number.

471
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,963
If you do end up taking
that 10 million dollars

472
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:21,726
because we could really
make the world a better place.

473
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:23,365
- (RETCHING)
- Whoa!

474
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,601
Oh, jeez!

475
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,806
Richard.

476
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:35,724
Hi, Monica. I work with Peter Gregory.

477
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:38,041
- We met outside the TED...
- Yeah, I remember you.

478
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:40,964
What... How'd you know I was here?

479
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,045
Peter Gregory is invested in a company
that uses GPS in phones to track people.

480
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:47,967
That's creepy.

481
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:49,964
You don't know the half of it.

482
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,804
And neither does Congress.

483
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,888
- Are you okay?
- Look, I don't want to waste your time.

484
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,725
I think I gotta take
the money from Gavin Belson.

485
00:22:59,800 --> 00:23:03,805
At least this way when I blow my eyeballs out
I'll have some money left for my family.

486
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,161
Jesus.

487
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,485
Sorry. That is a terrible doctor in there.

488
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,087
Richard, buried in that clunky UI of yours

489
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:18,085
is a compression algorithm
that blew our engineering team away.

490
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:20,520
And what do you think Hooli
is going to do with it?

491
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,723
I don't know. That's their business.

492
00:23:22,800 --> 00:23:24,086
This is your baby.

493
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,924
Do you even realize the impact

494
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,651
that a compression this good
could have on the world?

495
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:31,047
Getting any file on your mobile phone
in an instant.

496
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:35,610
Navigation data for self-driving cars,
mobile medical imagery,

497
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,286
all transmitting with no quality loss.

498
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:40,929
This is game-changing.

499
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,051
And don't you want to be
in the driver's seat when that happens?

500
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:48,567
You really want to just
turn it all over to Hooli and walk away?

501
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:53,041
Well, you are not making
this easier for me.

502
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,205
I'm not trying to.

503
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:56,805
I mean, you're actually making it worse.

504
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,406
My hands are tingling.
I have this metal taste in my mouth.

505
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,562
Actually, I can't go back in there,
so I'm going to go home.

506
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,041
- Let me give you a ride home.
- Good to see you again.

507
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,690
Uh, okay. Thanks.

508
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,640
Dude, where have you been?

509
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:12,125
Why won't you answer your phone?

510
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:14,123
Man, this has grown
way beyond AngelList, man.

511
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:17,443
Andreesen, Elevation and like a bunch of
other seed firms are piling onto this thing.

512
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,000
I mean, they've been calling Erlich.

513
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,850
He's out of control.

514
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,121
Yeah.

515
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,730
What if we took Peter Gregory's 200K
and built our own company?

516
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:29,160
I'm sorry. You said "we."

517
00:24:29,800 --> 00:24:31,370
Who's that in reference to exactly?

518
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,367
You, me, Dinesh, Big Head, us.

519
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,441
I mean, right now Pied
Piper just does audio,

520
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,450
but I'm thinking of ways
to compress images, video...

521
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,401
I mean, maybe Peter Gregory's right.
Maybe this thing could be huge.

522
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,802
Look, guys, for thousands of years

523
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:47,446
guys like us
have gotten the shit kicked out of us.

524
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,364
But now, for the first time,
we are living in an era

525
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:53,284
where we can be in charge
and build empires.

526
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:56,086
We could be the Vikings of our day.

527
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,489
- Vikings?
- How are you feeling?

528
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,251
You look super fucked up, to be honest.

529
00:25:02,840 --> 00:25:05,764
ERLICH: Who ate my fucking quinoa again?

530
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,601
So you're really about to go tell Erlich
that he's not going to get his $1 million?

531
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:11,768
Yeah, I don't want to be there
when you do that.

532
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:13,365
I would like to be there when you do that.

533
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,568
No, just stay here, please.

534
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,601
Hey-

535
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:23,921
Um...

536
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:29,286
So, I've been thinking about this whole
Peter Gregory, Gavin Belson thing.

537
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:33,847
And, um, I think I'm going
to go with Peter Gregory.

538
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,566
- Uh, which I know means...
- Richard.

539
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,804
I know that you look at me,
and see a guy who has it all figured out.

540
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,487
And for the most part, you're right, I do.

541
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,650
When I sold Aviato,

542
00:25:47,720 --> 00:25:51,361
it gave me a house, money, fancy clothes,

543
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,522
the universal respect of all the ladies.

544
00:25:54,280 --> 00:25:57,124
But there's always been a hole in my heart.

545
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,082
Not a literal hole like you would find
in some babies with congenital diseases,

546
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:04,083
but a metaphorical hole.

547
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:06,483
I guess that hole is the "What if."

548
00:26:07,000 --> 00:26:08,331
What if I didn't sell?

549
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,805
I'll never know.

550
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,802
And so I guess what I'm
saying to you now is,

551
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:16,010
you're like me, Richard.

552
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,250
You want to build something

553
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,084
and see it through.

554
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,321
Uh, so, just to be clear.

555
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,530
You're all right with me saying no to a deal
that will net you a million dollars outright?

556
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,489
No, Richard. I'm not all right with it.

557
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,369
I'm excited about it.

558
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,969
Let's see how high this
rocket can fly, partner.

559
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,411
Okay. Great.

560
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:42,163
That's great. Uh...

561
00:26:42,560 --> 00:26:43,846
Not partners, exactly.

562
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,441
But everything else is great.

563
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,364

- RICHARD: Hey, guys...

570
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:07,806
Guys, can I just kind of say
something real quick?

571
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,042
I know it's stupid but...

572
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:12,489
I just want to say, uh,

573
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:16,485
I'd like for this company
to just be different than Hooli

574
00:27:16,560 --> 00:27:18,608
and Goolybib and all the rest, you know?

575
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:21,411
Like, let's like not turn this
into a corporate cult

576
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,121
with bike meetings and voluntary retreats
that are actually mandatory.

577
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,329
And claiming to make the world
a better place all the time.

578
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,963
Let's, uh... Let's just think different.

579
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,083
Uh, don't think different. That's Apple.
